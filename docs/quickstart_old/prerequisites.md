1. **A computer that's on the public internet to run it on.** While crunching through video and serving it to viewers can be intensive from the computing side, you can get away with pretty meager resources on a simple setup. If you don't already have a server to run it on you can get a [Linode](https://www.linode.com/products/nanodes/) instance for $5/mo that runs it fine. If you worry that you'll be maxing out the bandwidth or transfer limits allotted to you, then utilize [External Storage](/docs/storage) very affordably (or even free for a certain amount) to serve the files instead.

   Here are some hosting providers people have been successful with.

   1. [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/)
   1. [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud)
   1. [Linode](https://www.linode.com/products/nanodes/)
   1. [Capsul](https://capsul.org/)

1. [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) v4.1.5 or greater needs to be available on your machine. If you use the [quick installer](/quickstart) it will try to download a copy of ffmpeg for you if needed. If you're using Docker, the image already contains it for you. _Note:_ **The Snap package of ffmpeg is not compatible with Owncast.**
