## Consuming this documentation

### Hate reading documentation?

Here's an AI chatbot that may help answer your questions about Owncast that uses the same documentation you're reading now. But it's only as good as a chatbot is, so you may be better off reading the documentation yourself.

import KapaChat from '../src/components/KapaChat.tsx'
