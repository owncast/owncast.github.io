Some streams benefit from announcing to their audience when they go live.

This is not an endorsement of any particular service, but it may help some streamers integrate into their existing communities.

If you'd like to expand on this and send automated notifications to other destinations, create a custom [webhook](/docs/api/webhooks).

        Using browser push notifications your viewers can choose to be notified each time you go live.

        Not all browser support this feature, and browser that do may handle it differently. Brave Browser, for example, require you to choose the duration the notifications are valid. They will likely want to select "Forever" to keep the notification active.

        ### Enabling browser notifications on iOS

        You can request to be notified when a stream goes live on iOS by following these steps:

        1.  Open Safari and navigate to your Owncast instance.
        2.  Tap the share icon at the bottom of your browser.
        3.  Tap "Add to Home Screen".
        4.  Tap the new Owncast icon on your home screen.
        5.  Press the "Notify" button.
        6.  Tap "Allow" when prompted.

    Another suggested way to receive browser notifications from any number of
    streams is by using the [Owncast Browser Extension by
    craftamap](https://github.com/craftamap/owncast-browser-extension). It's
    available for
    [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/owncast-extension/djgneammmklaajinkihpibdpaflehgio)
    and
    [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/owncast-extension/).

  The Fediverse social features have built in support to notify your followers
  when you go live. [Visit the documentation](/docs/social/) for more
  information.

  <TabItem value="discord" label="Discord">
        You can notify a Discord channel when your stream goes live. Visit the [Discord documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668) for complete instructions.

    - Visit Edit Channel / Integrations on your Discord channel.
    - Create a webhook.
    - Provide URL in the Owncast configuration.
