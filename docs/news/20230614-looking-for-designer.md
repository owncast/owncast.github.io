With the big v0.1.0 release behind us now is the time to start working on brand new features, but the project needs a designer to help!

Scheduled streams are on the roadmap and will require fresh UI to be designed around all the new functionality that the feature will bring. If you're a designer who thinks Owncast is pretty cool, and you're interested in spending some time with the project, this is a great opportunity.

This person would be responsible for helping the project from a high level, as we plan this new feature, as well as being the opinionated voice behind the detailed polish required to build new functionality that people love to use.

We’re still young in our design goals and would love your experience to inform both the process and the pixels around building a cohesive product.

If you’re curious and would like to learn more you’re welcome to visit our [public roadmap](https://owncast.online/roadmap) and read our [design overview](https://owncast.online/components/?path=/story/owncast-documentation-design--page).

If you're not a designer, but knows someone who is, please share this with them. Owncast continues to grow and we need your help to make it happen.

If you're interested, or have any questions, [please reach out](https://owncast.online/contact)!
