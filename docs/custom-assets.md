By creating a `data/public` directory and putting your own files there you can serve any assets that you wish to make publicly available for any reason.

Some exmples of reasons you might want to take advantage of this:

- Making a CSS font available so you can reference it in your custom CSS.
- You have images you wish to use in your page content.
- Some arbitrary files that you want people to download have no other place to be hosted.
