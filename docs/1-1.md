The best way for Owncast to be something that's useful to the most people is to hear what people have to say.

We have periodic group calls and events, but it's not always the easiest way to get your personal story, idea, or question heard so here is an opportunity to chat about Owncast on a personal video call.

If you are a current or prospective Owncast streamer who is interested in providing thoughts, feedback, or have questions to ask one-on-one we want to know what you have to say.

Or if you're interested in other aspects of the project from an open source, integration, or Fediverse prospective this is a good time to chat about that, as well.

Lastly, this is an opportunity if you're curious about finding a way to contribute to the project, but want to talk to somebody about it first.
