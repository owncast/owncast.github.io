There’s no point streaming if nobody is able to watch it. Using the “Stream Health” screen in the admin you can get an overview of some important metrics that may give you an idea if what you’re offering your viewers is leading to a good experience.

Seeing errors, low network speeds, and excessive download times for your content may mean you need to add additional video qualities to improve the playback performance for lower bandwidth viewers, mobile networks, or other factors.

If you're seeing on this page that people are experiencing issues playing back your stream, you may wish to [troubleshoot](/troubleshoot).

Note: Not all players will be represented in playback metrics as Owncast can only get detailed playback details in certain browsers, and not at all from external players (QuickTime, VLC, mpv, smart tvs, etc).
