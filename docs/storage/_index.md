Instead of serving video directly from your personal server you can use a S3 compatible storage provider to offload the bandwidth and storage requirements elsewhere. This is not for permanent storage of recordings or archival purposes, just for live streams.

## Configuration

Some storage providers, such as Oracle Cloud Objects, require the "path-style" configuration option to be enabled. Refer to your storage provider documentation to learn if this is required.
