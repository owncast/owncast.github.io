title: "Owncast and your privacy"
description: "Owncast exists so you can do your own thing. Privacy is the point."

Let's make this simple.

- If you run an Owncast server, you run your own software, therefore we don't know who you are or what you're doing.
- If you opt to be listed in the Owncast directory, everything we know about you is what is listed publicly.
- When you access our web servers, such as reading documentation or visiting the Owncast directory, we count the number of views. You can see everything we see by visiting our [web analytics page](https://plausible.io/owncast.online).
- If you use any Owncast supplied client applications, we have no analytics or data collection in them. We don't know who you are or what you're doing.
