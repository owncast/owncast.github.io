For most people Owncast will be completely usable out of the box without additional configuration. Simply following the [Quickstart](/quickstart) will have you streaming in minutes.

There are, however, handfuls of items you can configure to tweak the content of your page, [the video quality](/docs/video), [server performance](/docs/metrics) and more.

You can also [extend Owncast’s functionality](/docs/api) by building your own bots, overlays, tools and integrations by taking advantage of the third party APIs.
