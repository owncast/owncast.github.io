If you choose to use Linode as your hosting provider you can use the Linode One-Click-Install method.

**Note:** The Owncast Project may receive referral credit for deploying Owncast with Linode, so it's an easy way to support the project.

Linode has [written up a guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/deploy-owncast-with-marketplace-apps) as well that you may want to reference, but the following Owncast documentation goes into more detail that may be helpful to you.

1. Login to your DNS provider for your domain you used in step 3.
1. Add an "A Record" pointing to this ip address and the name you specified in step 3 (if you used owncast.mydomain.com then type in owncast).
1. Wait no less than 5 minutes for your server setup to complete and DNS to take effect. It may take longer depending on your DNS provider.
1. When you can access `http://ipaddress:8080` then the install is complete.
1. Reboot your new server.

## Test

1. In your browser make sure Owncast is running by visiting `http://ipaddress:8080`.
1. If you configured SSL by specifying a hostname, put that hostname in your browser to make sure you can access it via https, for example: `https://owncast.mydomain.com`.
1. Send a stream using your software to this hostname using abc123 as the stream key.
