## Support HTTPS

While not required, most people will want to support SSL on a public Owncast server. If you plan on [embedding](/docs/embed) your Owncast video or chat into another site or are offering your video to the public internet you're likely to need to add a SSL proxy to your setup. [Learn more about how to do this](/docs/sslproxies/nginx).

## Run as a system service

Most people will want to setup Owncast to automatically start in the background any time their server restarts. [Learn more about how to do this](/docs/systemservice/).
