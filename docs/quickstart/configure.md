While Owncast will work for you out of the box, there are things most people will want to customize after getting it up and running.

Configuration is done through the Owncast administration page located on your server under `/admin`. 

**Admin Authentication:**
- **Username:** `admin`  
- **Password:** your admin password (not your stream key)

The default admin password is `abc123`.

**Note:** Your stream key is only used by your streaming software to publish video; it is not your admin password.

Some common items many people would want to update after installing Owncast are:

* Your site name, logo, description and external links that are displayed on the [web site](/docs/website).
* The **stream key** to gain access to broadcasting to your stream and your admin.
* Enable your stream to show up in the [Owncast Directory](/docs/directory).
