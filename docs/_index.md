For most people Owncast will be completely usable out of the box without additional configuration. Simply following the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/installation) will have you streaming in minutes.

There are, however, handfuls of items you can configure to tweak the [content of your page](website), the [video quality](video), server performance and more.

You can also extend Owncast's functionality by building your own bots, overlays, tools and integrations by taking advantage of the [third party APIs](/docs/api/apis).
