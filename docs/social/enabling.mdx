## How to enable

This functionality is disabled by default. To enable social features on your Owncast server visit the _Configuration -> Social_ page.

### Requirements

1. You must be hosting your Owncast server behind SSL, with a _https_ URL. Setup a [HTTP Proxy](/docs/sslproxies/nginx) if needed.
1.

### Configuration

Visit the _Configuration -> Social_ page to configure.

1. You can set the username that you're seen as.
1. You can set the text that is sent out each time you go live.
1. You can toggle "Private mode".

:::warning
Once you set your server name and your username that's how people will see you. If you change either of those two settings you'll show up as a different user and your existing followers may no longer be following you. It is not suggested you change these after you set them.
:::

### Private mode

Enabling _Private Mode_ will require those who wish to follow your server to be approved by you first. Approving followers can be done via the _Followers_ section in the admin.

Private Mode will also make it so any posts you send out are only visible to your followers, not others, as they cannot be shared.
