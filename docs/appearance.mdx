It is highly recommended that you <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">familiarize yourself with CSS selectors</a> and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS variable syntax</a> to get the most out of customizing your Owncast instance. Soon you'll be able to make your Owncast page look how you'd like.
Using the <a href="#owncast-css-helper">Owncast CSS helper</a> below is a great way to get started.

## CSS Selectors

## CSS Variables

You can override the values assigned to CSS variables manually by setting them in the CSS editor in the admin.
You can find a list of [variable names](https://owncast.online/components/?path=/docs/owncast-styles-colors-palette--docs) you can override.

For example, if you'd like to make all action items (links, buttons) red, button borders green, and change the body font to a `serif` font, you can set the following CSS variables as follows:

```css
:root {
  --theme-color-action: red;
  --theme-color-components-primary-button-border: green;
  --theme-text-body-font-family: serif;
}
```

### Additional selectors and variables

While, using CSS, you can target any element on the page, if there are specific elements you find yourself having difficulty customizing, please open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Owncast GitHub repository</a> so we can consider adding additional selectors or CSS variables to make customization easier.
We will also likely add more customization options directly within Owncast's appearance page over time for common use cases. If you find yourself wanting to customize something specific, contributions are welcome!

## Owncast CSS helper

To assist in customizing your Owncast colors via CSS variables and customizing specific elements, use the CSS helper below. This is meant to give you a head start in writing your own CSS, not a complete solution.
Select colors using the color pickers, edit the CSS directly as needed, then copy and paste the result into your Owncast admin under <em>General Settings → Appearance.</em>

:::tip
You can copy and paste your custom CSS and share it with other Owncast users as themes!
