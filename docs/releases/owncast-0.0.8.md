---

Owncast v0.0.8 features a rewrite of the chat system to improve performance, stability, and user moderation along with changes intended to reduce unauthorized access to chat and its history.

As with all updates it also includes many fixes and improvements to continue improving the self-hosted streaming experience. Please read through the below release notes and let us know what you think about this release. Your feedback drives the roadmap of Owncast, and we want to build the things that are most useful to you.

Here are some notable chat updates you may be interested in:

### Moderation

While Owncast has had existing support for hiding chat messages, this new release is the first time you can ban an entire user from chat. By visiting the new `Chat -> Users` admin page and seeing the list of currently connected chat users, you can press the "Ban" button to disconnect them from chat, hide all their messages, and ban that user from reconnecting.

### Disabling chat

Turning off chat in the settings previously would hide the chat UI from your viewers, but the chat functionality still was enabled behind the scenes. Now if you turn it off chat is no longer supported. Because you can turn off chat completely the number of viewers is no longer counted by the number of people connected to chat, instead it is counted separately.

### Chat usernames

Under the new Chat settings page in the admin you can add a list of names or words you don't want to allow people to use in their chat usernames. This way you can stop people from having fake names like "Admin" to mislead people.

Also, default usernames are no longer "UserXX", but instead a randomly generated string.

### Chat connection limits

Previously we didn't suggest more than 1,000 people to be connected to the Owncast chat, but with this revision it's been tested to many times that, though you may see more or less depending on your server and how it's configured. In general most people should no longer be limited in chat capacity.

### Custom chat emoji

You can now input, and autocomplete, custom emoji in chat by typing `:emojiname:`. Hover over emoji in the chat to see the name of it. By typing part of an emoji name, such as `:dancing` and hitting `tab` it will attempt to auto-complete it for you just like it does with usernames when you type `@user` and hit `tab`.

### New standalone embeddable chat

There's now a standalone chat interface located at `/embed/chat/readwrite` that you can embed in an iframe anywhere you like, allowing you to easily have the full chat in a custom interface that you design.

This is also useful for streamers who just want to bring up a full-screen chat to use when streaming.

# Changelog

## [[0.0.8](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/13)] - 2021-08-11

## Upgrade instructions from 0.0.7

1. Stop the service from running. If you're using a pre-installed image through a hosting provider, or setup Owncast to run under systemd you can probably just simply run `systemctl stop owncast`.
1. Change to the directory where Owncast is installed on your server. In a pre-installed hosting scenario it's likely in `/opt/owncast`.
1. If you’ve customized your web interface in any way you will want to back up the files you’ve changed or customized.
1. Re-run the installer as the user you run Owncast under. For example if you are running owncast as the user "owncast": `su -c "curl https://owncast.online/install.sh |bash" owncast`
1. Restart the service. If you're running under systemd `systemctl start owncast`.
