## Happy 5 years!

This month marks 5 years of Owncast. It's been a lot of fun, and there's still so much more planned. Thank you for being patient during this time when it's primarily architectural updates, bug fixes, and small quality of life improvements that are being shipped before we can get to the big features. You can keep an eye on the roadmap at https://owncast.online/roadmap.

# Changelog

## [[0.2.3](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/30)] - 2025-05-10

## Upgrade instructions from 0.2.2

1. Stop the service from running. If you're using a pre-installed image through a hosting provider, or setup Owncast to run under systemd you can probably just simply run `systemctl stop owncast`.
1. Change to the directory where Owncast is installed on your server.
1. If you choose to use the installer script, re-run the installer as the user you run Owncast under. For example if you are running owncast as the user "owncast": `su -c "curl https://owncast.online/install.sh |bash" owncast`
1. Otherwise, overwrite your existing `owncast` binary with the new one. You can do this by downloading the latest release.
1. Restart the service. If you're running under systemd `systemctl start owncast`.

### Docker image

Alternatively, a container image is available via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncast/owncast) at `owncast/owncast`.
