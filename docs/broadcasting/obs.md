OBS is a popular piece of free software that will get you streaming from your own computer right away.

1. Install [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or [Streamlabs OBS](https://streamlabs.com/) and get it working with your local setup.
1. Open OBS Settings and go to "Stream".
2. Select "Custom..." as the service.
3. Enter the URL of the server running your streaming service in the format of rtmp://myserver.net/live.
4. Enter your "Stream Key" that matches a stream key defined in the Owncast admin. By default there is a single stream key that matches the default admin password of `abc123` but this should be changed.
5. Start the server.
6. Press "Start Streaming" (OBS) or "Go Live" (Streamlabs) on OBS.
