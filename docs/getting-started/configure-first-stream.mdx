Any piece of software you're already using for live streaming is likely compatible with Owncast. Visit our [broadcasting software](/docs/broadcasting) page to see some specific pieces of software and how they're configured.

## Stream Key

To begin streaming you'll first need your stream key and the RTMP URL of your Owncast server. Out of the box your stream key is the same as the admin password: `abc123`. You'll want to change these both as soon as possible.

Beginning with Owncast v0.1.0 the admin password and stream keys are managed independently, allowing you to add as many stream keys as you'd like.

While most people won't require having multiple stream keys, there are some specific scenarios where having this ability may be helpful.

In the admin server setup page you can add and remove these keys.

## Admin

Some common items many people would want to update after installing Owncast are:

- Your site name, logo, description and external links that are displayed on the [web site](/docs/configuration/website).
- The **stream key** to gain access to broadcasting to your stream and your admin.
- Enable your stream to show up in the [Owncast Directory](/docs/directory).
