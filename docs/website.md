## Overview

Owncast includes a web interface for your video with built-in chat that is available once you start the server. It shows online/offline states, viewer counts, stream duration, your instance's description, images, links and more. You can just start using it without making any changes, but you'll likely want to update the content displayed on your page by visiting your server admin page.

Additionally, the web interface was specifically built to be customizable by anybody comfortable tweaking colors and styles. No development environment is needed, just open the admin and start tweaking.

If you want to embed Owncast in your existing website, checkout our [documentation on embedding Owncast](/docs/embed/).

Below are some items you'll likely want to customize to update the content that displays on your page.

### Name and description

By setting your name, description and logo you can quickly update the contents of the website to reflect your stream.

### Tags

By setting tags you're showing potential viewers what categories of content you typically stream.

### External social links

You can add links to your profiles on other sites by adding them in the admin.

### Web page content

The body of your page content can be customized in your admin. Use standard [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to add links, images, and more.
