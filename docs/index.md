:::note
Create a new introduction page to welcome viewers to the documentation. It shouldn't be a list of links to docs, since that's what the sidebar is for. Instead, it should provide a brief overview of what Owncast is, what kind of documentation is available, and perhaps some guidance on where to start based on common user goals (e.g., installation, configuration, troubleshooting).
