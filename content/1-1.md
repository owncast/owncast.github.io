title: "Chat one-on-one about Owncast"

The best way for Owncast to be something that's useful to the most people is to hear what people have to say.

We have periodic group calls and events, but it's not always the easiest way to get your personal story, idea, or question heard.

If you are a current or prospective Owncast streamer who is interested in providing thoughts, feedback, or have questions to ask one-on-one we want to know what you have to say.

Or if you're interested in other aspects of the project from an open source, integration, or Fediverse prospective please reach out, as well.

This is also an opportunity if you're curious about finding a way to contribute to the project, but want to talk to somebody about it first.

[Schedule some time here](https://cal.com/gabek) or use the widget below.
