For most people Owncast will  be completely usable out of the box without additional configuration.  Simply following the [Quickstart](/quickstart) will have you streaming in minutes.

There are, however, handfuls of things you can configure to tweak the [content of your page](website), the [video quality](encoding), server performance and more.

You can also extend Owncast's functionality by building your own bots, overlays, tools and integrations by taking advantage of the [third party APIs](/thirdparty).
