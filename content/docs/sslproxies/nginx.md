NGINX is a popular web server used as a reverse proxy with free Let's Encrypt certificates.  Visit the [official documentation](https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/) for detailed instructions.

## Websockets

People often look over the need to tell NGINX to proxy websockets correctly, leading to chat being disabled.  Please read the quick [documentation by nginx around websocket support](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html) to make sure you're doing it properly.

You'll end up with a configuration that looks somewhat like the following when you're done setting up NGINX.

{{< highlight nginx >}}
server {
    server_name owncast.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
        
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
    
}
{{</ highlight >}}

Most probably in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf you will need to add the following into the http{} stanza:

{{< highlight nginx >}}
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
		default upgrade;               
                ''	close;
	}    
{{</ highlight >}}
