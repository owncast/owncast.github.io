In honor of [@mattdsteele](https://github.com/mattdsteele) and [@JCake](https://github.com/mattdsteele) live streaming their wedding using Owncast tomorrow, here's the first release version.

We've been testing, doing events and enjoying using Owncast, so I think it's time to have a release version that others can start using as well.

Still lots of exciting updates going on, but here's finally something that you can start using. Feel free to reach out and let us know what you're using Owncast for, or if you have any questions.

This release is also on Dockerhub if that's convinient for you.

```sh
docker pull gabekangas/owncast:0.0.1
```

You can get the release from [GitHub](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/releases/tag/v0.0.1) or [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/layers/gabekangas/owncast/0.0.1/images/sha256-90b28e787a3e79b5ec2486e3087f4cf708cdaa71ab6ebf92cd343bba6e8bb576?context=repo).

Congratulations Matt and Jessica!
