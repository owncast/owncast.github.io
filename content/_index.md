Owncast is a self-hosted live video and web chat server for use with existing popular broadcasting software.  Point your live stream at a server you personally control and regain ownership over your content.  [Read more about the project](/about).

## Start streaming to your own server in seconds

{{< highlight bash >}}
curl -s https://owncast.online/install.sh | bash
{{</ highlight >}}

{{< asciicast "/install-owncast-ascii.cast">}}

Now point your broadcast software, such as OBS, to `rtmp://<your public IP address>:1935/live` (default stream key is **abc123**) and start streaming!

There deserves to be a better option for people. Something you could run yourself and get all the functionality of these services, where you could live stream to an audience and and allow them to take part in the chat, just like they've been used to on all the other services.  **There should be a independent, standalone _Twitch in a Box_.**

## Getting Started

The goal is to have a single service that you can run that works out of the box. **Visit the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/) to get up and running.**
