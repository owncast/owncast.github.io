Since v0.1.0 is taking longer than hoped, this allows some updates to get out between now and then. But all the work for the new Owncast interface is coming along well and I look forward to getting it finished and putting in everyone&amp;rsquo;s hands.
[0.0.13] - 2022-11-25 Upgrade instructions from 0.0.12 Stop the service from running. If you&amp;rsquo;re using a pre-installed image through a hosting provider, or setup Owncast to run under systemd you can probably just simply run systemctl stop owncast.</description></item><item><title>Owncast v0.0.12</title><link>/releases/owncast-0.0.12/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/releases/owncast-0.0.12/</guid><description>This release has a handful of features, big and small, to improve the overall Owncast experience, primarily around the core streaming and chat functionality.
Chat User Menu This new dropdown menu should help clarify how you change your name, as it was not always clear to all viewers how to do so.
Stream Notifications To assist streamers in automating their live stream announcements, some new ways to notify your viewers and your community have been added.</description></item><item><title>Owncast v0.0.11</title><link>/releases/owncast-0.0.11/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/releases/owncast-0.0.11/</guid><description>Welcome to The Fediverse! With Owncast v0.0.11 your server can optionally become a part of the Fediverse, an interconnected, but completely independent network of servers where people can discover your stream. Some popular Fediverse services are Mastodon and Pleroma but many services that make up the Fediverse can start to receive posts from your Owncast server.
With this ability, it gives you something pretty cool: the ability for people to follow your server and share it with their own followers.</description></item><item><title>Owncast v0.0.10</title><link>/releases/owncast-0.0.10/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/releases/owncast-0.0.10/</guid><description>v0.0.10 is a hot fix to resolve an issue when using external S3 compatible storage in v0.0.9.
There are no other changes and this only impacts those using that feature. See the release notes for v0.0.9 for details around the previous release.

There&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of user-facing changes this time around, but take a look through the below changes and see if there&amp;rsquo;s anything that might impact you.
One thing that might make your life more convenient going forward is instead of putting in the full video URL /hls/stream.m3u8 when viewing an Owncast stream in an external video player (MPV, Quicktime, VLC) you can just put your root URL to your Owncast server.</description></item><item><title>Owncast v0.0.8</title><link>/releases/owncast-0.0.8/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/releases/owncast-0.0.8/</guid><description>Owncast v0.0.8 features a rewrite of the chat system to improve performance, stability, and user moderation along with changes intended to reduce unauthorized access to chat and its history.

The biggest being the ability to use hardware accelerated video codecs and free up your CPU if you&amp;rsquo;re running on dedicated hardware. This is great for people who are hosting from home, even on things like a Raspberry Pi. Other additions people have asked for such as being able to upload your logo directly from the admin, hiding chat, custom CSS, being able to manually select a video stream quality from the player and more are included in this update.</description></item><item><title>Owncast v0.0.6</title><link>/releases/owncast-0.0.6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/releases/owncast-0.0.6/</guid><description>0.0.6 has quite a few changes that impact you, so please take a moment to read about these changes in their entirety.
