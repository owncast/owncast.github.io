# Trademark Policy

This document outlines the guidelines for using the Owncast® name and trademarks. While our software is distributed under a free and open-source license, this does not give an automatic right to use our trademarks in all cases. Trademarks serve to identify the origin of products and services, so it's important they are used correctly.

You may use our trademarks under certain conditions outlined here. If your use is not described in this document, it is either not allowed, or you will need to seek permission. The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure our trademarks continue to represent high quality, without limiting the community's ability to engage with the Owncast project.

## Commitment to Open Source

We want to support community participation and the use of our trademarks in ways that benefit the project, its users, and the community as a whole. However, it's important that our trademarks remain clear indicators of our software's origin and limit confusion. This policy strikes a balance between protecting the integrity of our marks and allowing the community to use them appropriately.

## What is a Trademark?

A trademark is a name, logo, or other visual element that identifies the source of a product or service. Trademarks help ensure that consumers know where a product comes from and can trust its quality and origin.

### Likelihood of Confusion

Trademark infringement occurs when the use of a mark confuses people about the source of a product or service. For example, if two different software products are marketed under similar names, consumers may be misled into thinking they are from the same source. Or if Owncast has been modified, and then distributed under the same name, this could cause confusion about the official version and make supporting users more difficult.

## Trademarks Covered by This Policy

This policy applies to:

1. **Word Marks** such as **Owncast®**
2. **Logos**, including visual representations of our project
3. **Trade Dress**, which refers to the overall look and feel of our website or packaging.

The policy applies to both registered and unregistered trademarks.

## Nominative Use

In some cases, you can use a trademark without permission if it's necessary to describe a relationship between products or services. This is known as "nominative use." For example, you may say that your software is "compatible with Owncast," but you must avoid implying endorsement by the Owncast project.

## Logos

The Owncast logo is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1) license and may be used for creative "remixes", interpretations, documentation, and other non-commercial uses. If you provide Owncast hosting you may use the logo in your documentation and installation tools. It should not be used for branding of other software.

## General Rules for All Uses

Always use trademarks in their exact form—don't abbreviate, modify, or pluralize them. For example:

- Unacceptable: Own-cast, OwnCast
- Acceptable: Owncast

When using our trademarks, you must ensure that your use does not confuse others about what they are receiving and from whom. This is a key legal requirement and must guide all uses of our trademarks. For example, if you distribute a modified version of Owncast, you must not imply that it is the official version.

### Allowed Uses

- You may distribute the unmodified Owncast software and use our Word Marks and Logos as long as the software has not been altered. This applies whether you distribute it on physical media or via download.
- If you distribute modified versions of Owncast, you may use the Word Marks (e.g., "based on Owncast software") but not the Logos, as long as the modifications are made clear. You should describe your version as "powered by", "derived from" or "compatible with" Owncast, but it must be clear it's not the official version and has features and functionality that cannot be supported by the Project.
- You can use Word Marks to describe how your software works with or is compatible with Owncast, as long as you don't suggest it's endorsed by us.
- You may use the Word Marks to describe services related to Owncast, such as hosting, support, or consulting, but you may not brand your services using our marks. For example: "Owncast Hosting" is not permitted, but "Live Stream Hosting powered by Owncast" is.

### Infringing Uses

- Selling Owncast software (as it is otherwise available for free) is likely to be seen as infringing. Offering paid services, like support or hosting, is allowed, but charging for the software under the Owncast name is not. It is suggested you create your own commercial version of Owncast, under a different name to limit confusion.
- If you are not in compliance with the software's copyright license you may not use our marks.
- Registering or using any similar or derivative marks that could confuse others into thinking they are affiliated with Owncast.
- Using trademarks as adjectives rather than nouns or verbs. Avoid using them in possessive form or translating them into other languages.

### Websites

You may use our Word Marks and Logos on your website to show support for Owncast. Additionally, you can use Word Marks in domains or branding for your Owncast server instances like `owncast.example.com` or "Bob's Owncast Stream".

You may use our Trademarks on your website if:

- Your site's branding is distinct from our official branding.
- Your branding is more prominent than our Marks.
- You link back to the official Owncast site.
- Your site makes it clear that you are not endorsed by or affiliated with Owncast.

### Commercial Services

You may use Word Marks to advertise services for Owncast (such as installation, configuration, or hosting) but cannot use our marks to imply endorsement by the Owncast project.

### Publications and Presentations

Using Word Marks in books, articles, and presentations is allowed, as long as it's clear that the material is not published or endorsed by Owncast.

### Events

You can use our Marks to promote Owncast at community events, as long as it's clear that the event is independent of the official Owncast project.
