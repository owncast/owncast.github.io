The fewer frames of video that needs to be processed result in less hardware resources that will be used to process them. You can reduce both the framerate of what you send to Owncast and the framerate sent out to the viewers.

**Drawback**: Reducing the framerate may visibly decrease the quality of your stream for some content.
