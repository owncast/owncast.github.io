Unzip the release. Run ./owncast to start the service. Visit the admin at /admin to configure your server using the username admin and the default stream key as the password, abc123.</description></item><item><title>Use a container image</title><link>/quickstart/container/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/quickstart/container/</guid><description>Pull the latest version from Dockerhub: docker pull owncast/owncast:latest. Run docker run -v `pwd`/data:/app/data -p 8080:8080 -p 1935:1935 owncast/owncast:latest to start the service. This will bind the data directory so you have access to backups and your database in case you need to move it to another server. Alternatively, you can create a docker-compose.yml file with the following contents:
version: &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; services: owncast: image: owncast/owncast:latest ports: - &amp;#34;8080:8080&amp;#34; - &amp;#34;1935:1935&amp;#34; volumes: - .</description></item><item><title>Configure</title><link>/quickstart/configure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 20:11:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/quickstart/configure/</guid><description>While Owncast will work for you out of the box, there are things most people will want to customize after getting it up and running.
Configuration is done through the Owncast administration page located on your server under /admin.
Admin Authentication:
Username: admin Password: your admin password (not your stream key) The default admin password is abc123.
Note: Your stream key is only used by your streaming software to publish video; it is not your admin password.</description></item><item><title>Start Streaming</title><link>/quickstart/startstreaming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/quickstart/startstreaming/</guid><description>Any piece of software you&amp;rsquo;re already using for live streaming is likely compatible with Owncast. Visit our broadcasting software page to see some specific pieces of software and how they&amp;rsquo;re configured.
Point your broadcasting software at your new server using rtmp://yourserver/live with your stream key. If your software doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a way to specify a stream key simply use the url rtmp://yourserver/live/streamkey and use your specific stream key instead. Access your server in your web browser by visiting http://yourserver:8080.</description></item><item><title>Next Steps</title><link>/quickstart/nextsteps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/quickstart/nextsteps/</guid><description>Support HTTPS While not required, most people will want to support SSL on a public Owncast server.
