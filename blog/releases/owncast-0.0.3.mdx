[v0.0.3](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/3?closed=1) has a new admin dashboard to help get an overview of the configuration and performance of your Owncast server along with handfuls of additional updates.

## Owncast Admin

[v0.0.3](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/3?closed=1) introduces the web admin dashboard that you can use to get an overview of your owncast server.

Visit `/admin` and login with `admin` as the username and your stream key as the password.

We will continue to add functionality to this over time, so please [let us know how it works for you and if you have any feedback](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/discussions).

## Upgrade instructions from 0.0.2

1. Stop the service from running.
1. Backup your `config.yaml` and any other files you may have customized and want to save or refer to later.
1. Move the zip file of 0.0.3 to your previous install location.
1. Unzip the file, allowing it to overwrite old files.
1. Edit your `config.yaml` file and change the `logo` entry to be a single item, no longer a `small` and `large`. If you're using the default then it should look like the following: `logo: /img/logo.svg`. Take note the old `logo` images have been changed to `logo.svg`.
1. Move the `stats.json` file to `data`.
1. Move your `content.md` file to `data` if you have one.
1. Restart the service.

## Breaking changes

- How your logo is set in the config file has changed. See upgrade instructions.
- `chat.db` has been renamed to `owncast.db` and moved to the `data` directory. You should delete your old `chat.db` file.
- `content.md` has moved to to `/data`.
- `stats.json` has moved to `/data`.
- Optional `chatDatabase` command line flag is moved to `database`. `chatDatabaseFile` in config changed to `databaseFile`.
