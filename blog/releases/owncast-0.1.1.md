I hope everyone is enjoying all the changes and improvements from the web overhaul that came with v0.1.0. With so many changes we knew there'd be a a slew of bug fixes to come along after. And the first round of those are here.

Some changes you might be interested in:

- Chat is now re-sizable and there's a convenient way to get the "pop-out" chat window.
- Those who use object storage for their steams will now finally see their segments get cleaned up automatically by Owncast without having to configure lifecycle rules with their storage provider.
- There's a handful of fixes that should improve glitchy chat performance, including a bug where people using mobile Firefox on Android couldn't use chat at all.

# Changelog

## [[0.1.1](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/21)] - 2023-07-28

## Upgrade instructions from 0.1.0

1. Stop the service from running. If you're using a pre-installed image through a hosting provider, or setup Owncast to run under systemd you can probably just simply run `systemctl stop owncast`.
1. Change to the directory where Owncast is installed on your server.
1. If you’ve customized your web interface in any way you will want to back up the files you’ve changed or customized.
1. Re-run the installer as the user you run Owncast under. For example if you are running owncast as the user "owncast": `su -c "curl https://owncast.online/install.sh |bash" owncast`
1. Restart the service. If you're running under systemd `systemctl start owncast`.
