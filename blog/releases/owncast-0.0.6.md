0.0.6 has quite a few changes that impact you, so please take a moment to read about these changes in their entirety.

## Upgrade instructions from 0.0.5

1. Stop the service from running.
1. [Download the updated Owncast release](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/releases/tag/v0.0.6) for your platform.
1. Move the zip file of 0.0.6 to your previous install location.
1. If you've customized your web interface in any way **you will want to back up the files you've changed or customized.**
1. Unzip the file, allowing it to overwrite old files.
1. Restart the service.

For installing from scratch, see the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/installation).

## Breaking changes

- The config file has been removed in favor of the web admin.
- The "server title" value has been removed and the "server name" is used everywhere instead.
- Audio transcoding settings have been removed to simplify configuration as we haven't been encouraging people to convert audio, and as far as I can tell people haven't been using it. Audio will pass through the source audio as it has previously.
- Peak viewer counts have been removed from the public-facing `status` API. [\#771](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/pull/771)

## Docker

If you're running [Owncast under Docker](/docs/quickstart/container) it's suggested you bind your `data` directory so you have access to your database file, backups, etc.

## Major updates

### Admin

Beginning with 0.0.6 you will configure your Owncast server via the admin at `/admin`. You'll be able to make changes faster, easier, and without restarting your server. We hope with this updated interface that you'll be able to make simpler and more informed decisions about how to configure your server and video settings.

Please share any feedback you have as we want to continue to improve and make it easier and faster for you to run and manage your streams.

### Stream title

You'll now see in the admin a text field for adding an optional "Stream Title", a way to describe what your current stream is. This is especially useful for people who may stream multiple different things in one session, or every day have new content that you'd like to call out. So you can set it to "Playing Assassin's Creed", and then change it to "Doing some live coding".

## Third party integration & add-on APIs

Owncast now lets you build add-ons and integrations on top of it. Some good examples are chat bots, video stream overlays, changing the stream title when things happen, or creating chat actions such as notifying people when somebody has donated or followed.

[Learn more about these APIs](/docs/api/apis) and you can start building for your Owncast server. Feel free to ask us any questions. This is all brand new, and we want to give you what you need to build great things.

## Backups

The `backup` directory will include a periodic backup of your Owncast server data. Save this with other system data you backup and you'll be able to restore this data later if it's ever needed. [Learn more about backups](/docs/backups/).

### Owncast Directory

The [directory](https://directory.owncast.online) can be easily enabled in the admin via the General settings page. We look forward to seeing everyone's streams show up there if you're looking for viewers, or are streaming something that's publicly available.
