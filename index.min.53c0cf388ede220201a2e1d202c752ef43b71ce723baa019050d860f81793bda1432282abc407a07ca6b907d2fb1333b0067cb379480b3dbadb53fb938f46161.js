`},{id:9,href:"/docs/broadcasting/",title:"Broadcasting Software",description:"How you configure your broadcasting software can impact the quality and performance of your stream",content:`<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>In general Owncast is compatible with any software that uses <code>RTMP</code> to broadcast to a remote server. <code>RTMP</code> is what all the major live streaming services use, so if you&rsquo;re currently using one of those it&rsquo;s likely that you can point your existing software at your Owncast instance instead.</p>
<p>However, we haven&rsquo;t tested with everything. So if you&rsquo;re using something specific <a href="https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/new">we&rsquo;d love to hear what software you&rsquo;re using and the results</a>. If you&rsquo;re finding yourself running into issues, we&rsquo;d love to help troubleshoot.</p>
<h2 id="pointing-your-software-to-owncast">Pointing your software to Owncast</h2>
<p>Most broadcasting software will have a way to specify a &ldquo;custom&rdquo; location as a RTMP endpoint. In this case you would specify <code>rtmp://yourserver/live</code> as the RTMP destination, specifying your streaming key where it asks for it. The default stream key is <code>abc123</code> but you should change this immediately after setting up Owncast.</p>
<p>If your software doesn&rsquo;t have a place to specify a streaming key you can simply append it to your RTMP location, for example: <code>rtmp://yourserver/live/abc123</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-configure-your-broadcasting-software-matters">How you configure your broadcasting software matters</h2>
<p>You will want to configure your broadcasting software to match the highest quality you can offer your viewers. <strong>That means if your Owncast server can only handle 720p@2500k you should not configure your broadcasting software to send 1080p@6000k</strong>. The more conversion work you ask Owncast to do the more resources it will use on your server, making it even harder to offer the best qualities to your viewers.</p>
<p>Every server, environment, network speed and processing capacity is different. Just because you <em>want</em> to offer a certain quality doesn&rsquo;t mean your server can support it.</p>
<p>If you find yourself trying to squeeze better performance out of Owncast then try setting your broadcasting software to a lower quality as well as lowering the quality in your Owncast instance.</p>
<h2 id="broadcasting-settings">Broadcasting Settings</h2>
<p>The following are some suggested settings for a high quality stream you can set in your broadcasting software. But you should keep in mind the highest quality you&rsquo;ll be offering your viewers, as stated above. Continue to read more about the values.</p>

<h3 id="resolution-and-frame-rate">Resolution and Frame rate</h3>
<p>Resolution refers to the size of a video on a screen, and frame rate refers to how many frames per second are displayed. Full HD resolution is typically 1080p, 60 frames per second (fps). Streaming at a higher resolution like 1080p requires a higher bitrate, and a higher frame rate takes more encoding power. If you have the bandwidth and encoding power both on your broadcasting computer and your Owncast server to stream at 1080p, 60 fps, great! If not, try one of the other settings above to optimize your video quality and stability.</p>
<h3 id="bitrate">Bitrate</h3>
<p>The bitrate is the amount of data you send to your Owncast server when you stream. A higher bitrate takes up more of your available internet bandwidth. Increasing your bitrate can improve your video quality, but only up to a certain point.</p>
<h3 id="keyframe-interval">Keyframe Interval</h3>
<p>It is suggested you set your broadcasting software keyframe setting at <em>2</em> and <strong>not</strong> at <code>auto</code>.</p>
<h3 id="audio-settings">Audio settings</h3>
<p>Set your broadcasting software to send Owncast <code>AAC</code> audio.</p>
<h3 id="audio-bitrate-and-quality">Audio bitrate and quality</h3>
<p>When streaming also make sure to match your audio quality to what you&rsquo;re streaming. If you&rsquo;re a music focused stream then maybe go higher. If you&rsquo;re just talking, then maybe you can afford to go lower.</p>
<p>Owncast will not re-encode audio, so it will go out exactly how it&rsquo;s sent.</p>

<p>Read more about troubleshooting <a href="/troubleshoot/dropped-frames">Dropped frames</a> being reported in your broadcasting software.</p>
<h2 id="errors-or-disconnections">Errors or disconnections</h2>


<p>Make sure your broadcasting computer is broadcasting live video reliably. If your own computer or network connection is having a hard time getting video to the internet then viewers will be stuck in a buffering state. Reduce the bitrate, resolution and/or framerate in your broadcasting software on broadcasting device if needed.</p>
<p>Take note of any dropped frames and investigate what’s causing those drops. Is it your local CPU or GPU? Is it your local network? Or is it the Owncast server dropping them due to hardware usage?</p>
<p>If, for example, your <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/GPU-overload-issues">GPU on your broadcasting computer is maxed out</a> then it can&rsquo;t keep up rendering frames. If you&rsquo;re using OBS, one way to determine this is look at the &ldquo;Stats&rdquo; in the application and see if you&rsquo;re experiencing any &ldquo;Rendering Lag&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a service used to geographically distribute your content to end users. It helps to improve performance by reducing the time it takes to load content.</p>
<span class="version-support">
  Cdn support was first supported in <a href="https://github.com/owncast/owncast/releases/tag/v0.1.0">Owncast 0.1.0</a>.
</span>

<div class="alert alert-warning d-flex" role="alert">
  <div class="flex-shrink-1 alert-icon">💡</div>
  <div class="w-100">While the actual configuration of a CDN is not overly complex, it should be seen as a slightly advanced topic as you'll be making DNS changes and managing a CDN configuration with a provider.</div>
</div>
<p>A CDN works by distributing the content across multiple servers strategically placed in various geographic locations. This distribution ensures that content is delivered from a server that is physically closer to the user, reducing the distance data needs to travel. It also helps to alleviate the load on the origin (your Owncast server) by offloading the delivery of content to the CDN servers.</p>
<p>CDNs employ caching to store content. When a user requests content that is already cached in the CDN server, it can be delivered quickly without needing to retrieve it from the origin server. This caching mechanism improves the overall speed and responsiveness of your content.</p>
<p>In addition to caching, CDNs may also provide other optimization features such as data compression and security measures like DDoS protection. These additional features contribute to further improving the performance, scalability, and availability of websites and web applications.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-this-helpful-with-your-owncast-stream">How is this helpful with your Owncast stream?</h2>
<p>By putting a CDN in front of your Owncast instance it can be useful for viewers of your stream who may be geographically distant from your actual server, making it slower to stream your video, potentially causing buffering or other issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, your entire Owncast web page will load faster for all visitors, as the CDN will cache and serve the static assets (like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc) that make up your Owncast instance.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-storage-provider-and-a-cdn">What is the difference between a storage provider and a CDN?</h2>
<p>CDNs are designed to improve delivery performance and reduce latency by caching and distributing content from servers located closer to users. Storage providers focus on providing scalable and reliable storage infrastructure for storing data. While there may be some overlap in functionalities, their primary objectives and features differentiate them from each other.</p>
<p>While CDNs and storage providers are two different services, some object storage providers may offer built in CDNs that can be enabled.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-use-a-cdn-with-owncast">How can you use a CDN with Owncast?</h2>
<p>While it&rsquo;s impossible to go into detail for every CDN provider and configuration, here are the high level steps you&rsquo;ll need to take to put a CDN in front of your Owncast instance.</p>
<h3 id="without-a-storage-provider">Without a storage provider</h3>
<ol>
<li>Your actual Owncast server, known to a CDN as the &ldquo;origin&rdquo;, will need a publicly available hostname that is different than the one you use to access your Owncast instance. For example, if you want your viewers to access your Owncast instance at <code>https://owncast.example.com</code> you&rsquo;ll need to create a new hostname like <code>owncast-origin.example.com</code> and point it to your Owncast server.</li>
<li>In your CDN configuration you&rsquo;ll need to tell it to use <code>owncast-origin.example.com</code> as the origin for your Owncast instance.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to update your DNS configuration to point your Owncast hostname to your CDN. For example, if you access your Owncast instance at <code>https://owncast.example.com</code> you&rsquo;ll need to update your DNS configuration to point <code>owncast.example.com</code> to your CDN instead of your actual server.</li>
<li>Visit your Owncast admin and under &ldquo;Server Settings&rdquo; under &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll set the websocket override to point to the origin hostname you created in step 1. For example, <code>wss://owncast-origin.example.com</code>. If you don&rsquo;t perform this step your chat will no longer be accessible for CDN providers who do not support passing through websockets.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="with-an-external-storage-provider">With an external storage provider</h3>
<ol>
<li>In this configuration your storage provider is the origin server, not your Owncast server.</li>
<li>Get the endpoint hostname for your storage bucket from your provider.</li>
<li>In your CDN configuration you&rsquo;ll need to tell it to use the storage provider hostname as the origin server.</li>
<li>In the Owncast admin under &ldquo;Storage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll set the &ldquo;Serving endpoint&rdquo; to be the hostname of your CDN deployment.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to consider</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your Owncast server (the origin server) must still be on a network fast enough for the CDN to access your content and distribute it to your viewers. Simply adding a CDN won&rsquo;t automatically make your Owncast&rsquo;s network faster, though it may reduce the network load of your server via caching.</li>
<li>In some cases using a CDN in front of your Owncast server makes it more difficult for Owncast to have an accurate count of how many viewers you have. This is a tradeoff you&rsquo;ll need to consider. Generally if you have a low number of viewers it will report a higher number of viewers than you actually have (due to multiple CDN servers fetching your content), and if you have a large number of users it will report a lower number of viewers than you actually have (due to multiple viewers watching the same cached content). Updates to Owncast to help improve this are planned.</li>
<li>The more viewers you have, the more useful a CDN will be. If you have a small number of viewers it&rsquo;s likely every request will be hitting your origin server anyway, so a CDN won&rsquo;t be as useful, and even potentially detrimental to viewers in some cases since it requires an additional network hop. Refer to your CDN statistics to see how many requests are being served from the CDN cache (hits) vs your origin server (misses).</li>

<p>Owncast supports embedding your video stream directly into any other web site or source without having to setup a player.</p>
<p>The video-only URL to your stream content lives at: <code>http://your.host/embed/video</code>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some example HTML you can use.</p>

</iframe>
<p>Embedded videos will not start playing before the user presses the play button. This means that no sound will appear when a page with an embedded video is loaded. If you would like the player to additionally be muted once it does start playing, you can append <code>?initiallyMuted=true</code> to the URL (so it looks something like <code>http://your.host/embed/video?initiallyMuted=true</code>). Users will still be able to unmute the video manually once it&rsquo;s playing.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-the-embedded-stream-styling">Customizing the Embedded Stream Styling</h2>
<p>You can easily customize the styling of the embedded Owncast stream to match your website&rsquo;s design by applying CSS styles. Here&rsquo;s how you can do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a CSS File:</strong> First, create a CSS file (e.g., <code>stream-styles.css</code>) where you&rsquo;ll define your custom styles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link the CSS File:</strong> In the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your HTML document where you embed the Owncast stream, add a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to include your CSS file. Make sure to add this line before the closing <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">link</span> <span class="na">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;stylesheet&#34;</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#34;path/to/stream-styles.css&#34;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Replace &ldquo;path/to/stream-styles.css&rdquo; with the actual path to your CSS file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply Styles:</strong> Customize the styles in your stream-styles.css file according to your preferences. You can target the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element using CSS selectors, as shown in the example below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="line"><span class="cl"> <span class="c">/* Customize the embedded stream container */</span>

<p><strong>Customize to Your Needs:</strong> Feel free to modify the styles provided in the example above to match your website&rsquo;s design and layout.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate your Owncast stream into your website while maintaining control over its visual appearance.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-hls-feed">Using the HLS feed</h3>
<p>As long as the player supports it, it is recommended to open the homepage of your Owncast instance directly.
The player will automatically find the correct playlist and will start playing.
This will guarantee forward compatibility if the way how Owncast publishes HLS is ever changed.</p>
<p>However, if you need the HLS feed (i.e. for sharing your stream to a 3rd party player), you can access the HLS feed directly via this URL: <code>http://your.host/hls/stream.m3u8</code>.</p>
<h3 id="mute-by-default">Mute by default</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;d prefer your embedded video to be muted by default, you can add <code>?initiallyMuted=true</code> to the end of the <code>/embed/video</code> URL.</p>
<h2 id="embedding-chat">Embedding chat</h2>
<p>Owncast supports embedding your chat directly into any other website or source.</p>
<p>There are two types of embed chats: A read-only chat which only shows the messages and a standalone chat which has the same functionality as the one within the main Owncast web interface.</p>
<h3 id="embedding-standalone-chat">Embedding standalone chat</h3>
<p>The standalone chat URL lives at: <code>http://your.host/embed/chat/readwrite</code>.</p>
<span class="version-support">
  Embedding standalone chat was first supported in <a href="https://github.com/owncast/owncast/releases/tag/v0.0.8">Owncast 0.0.8</a>.
</span>

<p>It will look something like:</p>
<iframe src="https://watch.owncast.online/embed/chat/readwrite" title="Owncast"

allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<h3 id="embedding-read-only-chat">Embedding read-only chat</h3>
<p>The read-only chat URL lives at: <code>http://your.host/embed/chat/readonly</code>.</p>
<p>One common use of read-only chat is adding the chat messages to your broadcasting software, such as a web layer in OBS.</p>
<h4 id="using-obs">Using OBS</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click the <code>+</code> or right mouse click to add a new source. Choose <code>Browser</code> from the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a new source, you will need to add the name. Type in &ldquo;<em>Chat</em>&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Browser Source settings, you will need to change the URL to your Owncast instance&rsquo;s <code>/embed/chat/readonly</code> url.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use the <em>Custom CSS</em> to tweak how the browser shows your video. The following example will add some space around the box, give it a semi-transparent dark background; and increase the overall font size to a base unit of 24px. You may change any of these settings to fit your presentation layout. Note that the overall message text color is white.

<h2 id="base-knowledge">Base knowledge</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s very helpful for you to understand the basics included in video streaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: Used to transcode the video to multiple qualities so viewers can watch it on different speed networks.</li>
<li>Network bandwidth: Used to distribute the video to your viewers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="viewer-count-does-not-impact-cpu-use">Viewer count does not impact CPU use</h3>
<p>Knowing this, you see that <strong>CPU usage is the same regardless of how many viewers you have</strong>. 0 or 100, the CPU is still performing the work. Think of it like creating a zip file. If you have a 100MB file, and you zip it, and it becomes 70MB, you can send that 70MB file to as many people as you want without zipping that file again for each person. But you still need to send the file to each person seperately, requiring network bandwidth for each time you send it. However, if you want to send some people a 70MB version and others a 50MB version, you&rsquo;ll need to create two seperate files. That 50MB version will take longer and use more CPU to create, because of the additional work it takes to compress the file more. This is the same with video. The more work required to encode your video, the more CPU that&rsquo;s required. Generally, the more you need to reduce the size and bitrate of your video, the more CPU that will be used. But offering low bitrate/lower quality versions of your stream is important to enable more viewers to watch it from across the world, on any kind of network.</p>
<p>Now that you understand the basics, let&rsquo;s use an example to illustrate how your configuration can impact your server&rsquo;s resources, and most importantly, your viewers&rsquo; experience. It&rsquo;s a little simplistic and the actual numbers can vary in real life, but it could help answer the question of &ldquo;approximately how much bandwidth and CPU will Owncast use?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="example-scenario">Example Scenario</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve configured your broadcasting source (such as OBS) to stream to your Owncast instance at <strong>5000kbps</strong>. You have <strong>25 viewers</strong>. <strong>5</strong> of them are on slow or mobile networks, <strong>17</strong> of them have fast, stable internet, and <strong>3</strong> of them have fast internet most of the time but the speed fluctuates. All 25 viewers watched an entire stream that lasts two hours. You have a hosting provider that gives you 4TB of bandwidth per month.</p>
<h3 id="offer-a-high-and-low-quality-option">Offer a high and low quality option</h3>
<p>You decide to offer both a high and low quality option, and you set the high quality option to 5000kbps and the low quality option to 1500kbps.</p>

<p><strong>Result</strong>: You&rsquo;ve provided both a high and low quality option for your viewers so those with a slow network have an option, and those with a fast network that might periodically slow down can dip down into the low quality when needed. Additionally, in this case you saved almost 20G of bandwidth traffic due to offering a lower quality. You&rsquo;re using more CPU for a much better experience. You would be able to stream 43 times in a month before you hit your bandwidth limit.</p>

<p>If you have concerns about your hosting plan, bandwidth allocation or viewership growth you can use a S3 storage provider instead of your server for bandwidth responsibilities. In this example you again decide to offer both a high and low quality option, and you set the high quality option to 5000kbps and the low quality option to 1500kbps. The CPU used is the same as the above example for the high+low quality option. Learn more about <a href="/docs/storage">S3 compatible storage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Result</strong>: You&rsquo;ve provided both a high and low quality option for your viewers so those with a slow network have an option, and those with a fast network that might periodically slow down can dip down into the low quality when needed. However, these video qualities are not being served from your Owncast server, but instead an external S3 compatible storage provider. This allows for increasing your viewership and adding additional video qualities without concern of you exhausting your server&rsquo;s bandwidth allocation. You would be able to stream 24/7 without worry using this configuration, however you&rsquo;d be using the same amount of your server bandwidth if you had zero viewers or 100 viewers. Your CPU usage would be the same as if you were serving the video directly from your server.</p>
<h2 id="summarized-faq">Summarized FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="how-much-bandwidth-will-owncast-use">How much bandwidth will Owncast use?</h3>
<p>It depends on your configuration and how many viewers you have. If you offer more video quality options you will often reduce your network transfer requirements. Look into object storage (S3) to reduce your server&rsquo;s network requirements.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-cpu-will-owncast-use">How much CPU will Owncast use?</h3>
<p>It depends on how many different quality output options you are offering your viewers and what those qualities are.</p>
<h3 id="does-cpu-usage-increase-with-more-viewers">Does CPU usage increase with more viewers?</h3>
<p>Not in a meaningful way. There are limits when you&rsquo;re talking tens of thousands of chat participants, however.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-cpu-is-used-for-each-output-quality">How much CPU is used for each output quality?</h3>
<p>It depends on your configuration, but generally if you said one CPU core for each quality you&rsquo;re offering, that&rsquo;s a good rule of thumb. But it&rsquo;s not a hard rule and can be less.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-frame-rate-affect-cpu-usage">How does frame rate affect CPU usage?</h3>
<p>The fewer frames, the less CPU that is used. If you want to reduce the CPU being used on one of your video qualities you can reduce the frame rate. If you want to reduce the CPU being used for all of Owncast you can reduce the frame rate of your inbound source content in your broadcasting software, such as OBS.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-disk-space-will-owncast-use">How much disk space will Owncast use?</h3>
<p>Almost none, as the live stream is cleaned up in real-time as you stream.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-just-offer-one-quality-the-highest-possible-to-lower-the-cpu-requirements-i-only-want-people-to-see-the-best-quality-video-anyway">Can I just offer one quality, the highest possible, to lower the CPU requirements? I only want people to see the best quality video, anyway.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about you, your bandwidth, or your CPU. It&rsquo;s about your viewers. Not everyone can watch the highest quality. If they can&rsquo;t watch your stream because you didn&rsquo;t have them in mind then it&rsquo;s not worth streaming in the first place.</p>

<p>Private Mode will also make it so any posts you send out are only visible to your followers, not others, as they cannot be shared.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-people-follow-your-owncast-server">How do people follow your Owncast server?</h2>
<p>Any person on the Fediverse using a service that is compatible with following Owncast, such as <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> or <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> can follow your server.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>The Fediverse is an ensemble of decentralized and interconnected servers that are used for social networking, microblogging and more. While each server is independently hosted, they communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Each Owncast instance operates as a completely standalone server with a single user that can take part in the Fediverse, exchanging posts and notifications with any participating user who is interested in them.</p>
<p>Any user on the Fediverse that is on a compatible server can follow any Owncast server that has this feature enabled.</p>
<h2 id="composing-messages-to-your-followers">Composing messages to your followers</h2>
<p>By clicking the <em>Compose</em> button in the admin header you can create a post to send to your followers. This could be used to tell people when you plan on streaming, or to remind people that you&rsquo;re still live.</p>
<h2 id="engagement">Engagement</h2>
<p>If somebody <strong>follows</strong> you, <strong>likes</strong> a post you send out, or <strong>shares</strong> any of your posts while a stream is live it will display that these actions took place within the chat feed. This can be disabled under the social settings.</p>

<p>When banning a user Owncast will automatically block their known IP address. While this can deter most trolls,
like anything else, it is possible to evade.</p>
<ul>
<li>Owncast uses the IP address as provided in the <code>x-forwarded-for</code> header if it&rsquo;s provided, meaning it may be possible
for somebody to override this value with a fake address. If you&rsquo;re concerned about this, make sure your reverse proxy
is configured to explicitly set the correct header value.</li>
<li>VPNs are a thing. By using a VPN it&rsquo;s trivial to evade the IP address ban.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all to say: This feature will help keep abuse down, but in no way does it guarantee that it will keep the
worst of the worst away. Moderation is still the responsibility of each individual stream.</p>
<p>A list of blocked IPs can be viewed in the Admin Chat Users interface and can be un-banned via the same interface.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

</ol>
<h2 id="your-stream-can-be-played-outside-of-your-web-site">Your stream can be played outside of your web site.</h2>
<p>Because Owncast uses the HLS standard, almost any video player can play your stream. You can also build your own app that plays it. Commonly used video player such as Quicktime, VLC, and mpv can play your stream simply by using its base URL as <code>https://owncast.mydomain.com</code>. Alternatively, you can also access your stream directly on your server by putting the path of <code>/hls/stream.m3u8</code> into your player. For example: <code>https://owncast.mydomain.com/hls/stream.m3u8</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-an-owncast-video-stream-work">How does an Owncast video stream work?</h2>
<p>Owncast takes your source stream and converts it to short, individual video segments. A list of these segments is supplied to your viewer&rsquo;s player and will read and play all the segments in order. This is using a specification called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming">HLS</a> or HTTP Live Streaming. You can optionally generate multiple different qualities of video to allow lower bandwidth options. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_bitrate_streaming">Adaptive bitrate streaming</a>.</p>
<p>This video from Jon Dahl is gives a very good overview of internet video, starting with <em>&ldquo;what happens when you press play in your web browser?&rdquo;</em> and touching on every piece of the stack, backend and frontend. It translates very well to how Owncast works and is suggested if you want to learn more.</p>

</div>

<p>In this case Owncast works as the Media encoder, Stream segmenter, and distribution web server. However <a href="/docs/storage">Owncast supports video being distributed via 3rd party storage as well</a>, so in that case the video segments would be distributed from there, instead.</p>

<h4 id="things-to-keep-in-mind">Things to keep in mind.</h4>
<ol>
<li>The more work you need done to convert the video from one size, quality or format to another the more it will slow everything else down.</li>
<li>The slower things go the slower the stream is provided to the user.</li>
<li>If stream is provided to the user too slowly they&rsquo;ll start seeing buffering and errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what knobs can be tweaked when trying to determine the quality or qualities you want to provide your user while balancing the amount of server resources you&rsquo;re consuming.</p>
<h2 id="things-you-can-configure">Things you can configure</h2>
<h3 id="bitrate">Bitrate</h3>
<p>The bitrate is the amount of data you send when you stream. A higher bitrate takes up more available internet bandwidth and create larger sized segments of video, making it take longer for viewers to download. Increasing your bitrate can improve your video quality, but only up to a certain point.</p>
<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>
<p>Resolution refers to the size of a video on a screen. Like bitrates you can provide multiple different sizes for different cases, but asking to resize a video amounts in additional work that needs to be performed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s recommended if you have to change the size to only change the width <strong>or</strong> the height, and it&rsquo;ll keep the correct aspect ratio for you. If you change both the width and the height you may be changing the aspect ratio of the video you may end up with a squished picture if you don&rsquo;t set it correctly.</p>
<h3 id="framerate">Framerate</h3>
<p>Framerate is the number of frames per second in the video. Owncast defaults to 24fps, but other common framerates are 30 or 60. Increasing the framerate will use more CPU on your server, and more bandwidth for your users as more frames of video have to be processed and made available to your viewers any given second.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-usage">CPU Usage</h3>
<p>The more CPU you use the better the output image will be, or the smaller of a file the output will be for the same quality. However, you will need to balance the amount of CPU you have available with the amount you can use to process video.</p>


<p>If your hardware is being maxed out then your video may not be processed and delivered fast enough to keep up with the real-time requirements of live video.</p>
<p>Each stream output quality adds significant CPU usage and slows down the overall generation of video segments. It&rsquo;s generally advised to start with one output, and then add additional, one at a time, to see how it impacts your CPU usage.</p>
<p>If your CPU is being over-utilized, here are some steps you can try taking to resolve this.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may have too many video outputs defined in your settings. Try limiting yourself to a single output, and go from there.</li>
<li>Change your settings to use <a href="/docs/encoding/#cpu-usage">less cpu</a>.</li>
<li>Experiment with reducing the bitrate and framerate of your video.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve gone down to a single output, changed to using less cpu, and experimented with different qualities in your broadcasting software, it&rsquo;s possible the server you&rsquo;re running Owncast is just not powerful enough for the task and you might need to try a different environment to run this on.</li>
<li>For your highest quality, match your Owncast server output bitrate exactly to what your broadcasting software is sending to minimize the amount of work your server has to do.</li>
<li>If you find you cannot accomplish encoding of any sort due to your server hardware, you may want to experiment with enabling <a href="/docs/video/#video-passthrough">video passthrough</a>, where your video is not re-encoded. However, this may not be a solution in all environments and there are often side effects. <a href="/docs/video/#video-passthrough">Read more</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, the easiest way to save CPU is to decrease the input size, decrease the output size, or both.</p>



<p>One easy optimization for CPU usage is to make sure your inbound video matches your highest output quality.</p>
<p>The highest bitrate, resolution and framerate quality you have configured in Owncast to offer your viewers should match what you&rsquo;re sending Owncast in your broadcasting software to reduce the amount of extra CPU work it needs to do. Start with your highest quality matching your broadcasting software and then go from there. Lower qualities, of course, should be offered for people with slower network connections or are geographically distant.</p>

<h3 id="latency-buffer">Latency Buffer</h3>
<p>You have some control over the live latency between the broadcaster and the viewer. While it&rsquo;s completely understandable to want to have as little latency as possible you may need to increase the latency buffer if you&rsquo;re experiencing issues. In general the lower the latency the less buffer is available for any possible slow transfers, network blips or errors.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning d-flex" role="alert">
  <div class="flex-shrink-1 alert-icon">💡</div>
  <div class="w-100">If you require real-time, video conferencing style latency you may want to look for a different solution that doesn't use HLS video, as this scaling and distribution model will never get to sub-second levels.</div>
</div>
<h3 id="player-lower-latency-mode">Player Lower Latency Mode</h3>
<p>For some browsers, a &ldquo;Lower latency&rdquo; option is available in the web player. This should be seen as an experimental feature that will improve over time. If you turn it on and experience a negative playback experience with increased buffering you will probably want to turn it off.</p>
<span class="version-support">
  Experimental player lower latency mode was first supported in <a href="https://github.com/owncast/owncast/releases/tag/v0.0.12">Owncast 0.0.12</a>.
</span>

<h3 id="video-passthrough">Video Passthrough</h3>
<div class="alert alert-warning d-flex" role="alert">
  <div class="flex-shrink-1 alert-icon">💡</div>
  <div class="w-100">Turning on video passthrough may make your stream unplayable or unreliable, and is not recommended. Read about Video Passthrough before turning it on and learn about the risks involved.</div>
</div>


<p><strong>Note: This is generally not recommended and can often cause playback issues for your viewers.</strong></p>
<p>This is an advanced setting that most people should not use.</p>
<p>Owncast has an optional setting to turn off re-encoding of your inbound stream, potentially saving substantial hardware utilization and supporting a higher quality stream with less resources. <span style="color: red;"> <strong>However</strong>, because your video will not be re-encoded it&rsquo;s possible that certain video from certain sources may end up <strong>not being playable at all</strong></span>. This is the risk of enabling this.</p>
<p>To enable, visit the advanced settings for a specific stream output. You can turn on &ldquo;Video Passthrough&rdquo;.</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn it on if you require it.</li>
<li>Test it.</li>
<li>If your video won&rsquo;t play, <strong>then turn it off</strong>.</li>
<li>Only one output should be set as &ldquo;passthrough&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because enabling Passthrough tells Owncast to not encode your video at all, your stream is at the mercy of what your broadcasting software is sending, and that is often not highly compatible with live streaming. For example your live latency may be substantially higher than expected because the stream is not able to be broken up into the specifically sized chunks, as expected. This can also cause issues when switching between different video qualities. For example, switching between a passthrough quality and an properly encoded quality. Worst case your stream may not be playable at all with passthrough enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Drawback</strong>: Passthrough bypasses the Owncast video encoding pipeline, leading to video that is not processed for live streaming. This can lead to unexpected results <strong>including longer than expected latency</strong>, skips or &ldquo;blips&rdquo; in video playback. Or worst case, the video is not playable at all. <strong>This setting is not encouraged.</strong></p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>
<p>What you&rsquo;re sending from your broadcasting software is generally reasonable and additional conversion isn&rsquo;t required, even for low-bandwidth viewers. Owncast will not change the audio stream and instead just pass it along to the end users to save additional work being performed.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-configure-your-broadcasting-software-matters">How you configure your broadcasting software matters.</h2>
<p>You will want to configure your broadcasting software to match the highest quality you can offer your viewers. <strong>That means if your Owncast server can only handle 720p@2500k you should not configure your broadcasting software to send 1080p@6000k</strong>. The more conversion work you ask Owncast to do the more resources it will use on your server, making it even harder to offer the best qualities to your viewers.</p>
<p>If you find yourself trying to squeeze better performance out of Owncast then try setting your broadcasting software to a lower quality as well as lowering the quality in your Owncast instance.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-accelerated-video-encoding">Hardware accelerated video encoding</h2>
<p>If you are running on physical hardware you may be able to increase the performance of your Owncast instance by using your hardware along with a compatible codec, taking the heavy load off of your CPU. There is no guarantee all hardware configurations, drivers or operating systems will work and it may take some effort on your part to install all of the additional software required to get it working.

`},{id:28,href:"/docs/api/",title:"API Documentation",description:null,content:`<p>Owncast offers an API to integrate its services in other interfaces, like the <a href="https://github.com/owncast/owncast-admin">Owncast Admin Panel</a>.</p>
<h2 id="internal-vs-external-apis">Internal vs. External APIs</h2>
<p>API endpoints are split up between the internal (including admin) and external (aka integration) APIs. The internal APIs are used by the Owncast server itself to function. Some are required by just the web frontend, and others are used for management of the server via the admin interface. The external (or integrations) APIs are used by external clients such as integrations, bots, or custom tooling to perform actions and build additional functionality.</p>
<p>Internal APIs can change frequently as they are required to be in sync with the feature sets and requirements for the current version of Owncast. The goal of external APIs are to allow external tools to be integrated into Owncast without major changes breaking them. They are also secured via an access token instead of your admin password so you don&rsquo;t have to hand over full access to your Owncast server, and you can revoke access to external integrations at any time.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-use-admin-and-internal-apis-in-your-tools">Can you use admin and internal APIs in your tools?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re building for yourself, then it&rsquo;s your server and you can absolutely do whatever you want! However, the downside of using admin APIs is you need to share your admin password with whatever tooling is using it. This is not recommended.</p>
<p>Additionally if you&rsquo;re using the APIs that are required to drive the Owncast web frontend, those can change at any time and break whatever you&rsquo;re building. So especially if you&rsquo;re building integrations or third party tooling that other people are to use it&rsquo;s highly not recommended to use admin APIs, as they&rsquo;d have to hand over their admin password, or to use the internal APIs as they can change between versions and break your integration.</p>

This is not for permanent storage of recordings or archival purposes, just for live streams.</p>
<p>To learn more about how your bandwidth may be affected by your video configuration and how using object storage could help for some use cases, visit the <a href="/docs/resources-requirements/">resources and requirements</a> page.</p>
<p>If your storage provider is S3 compatible it will likely work with Owncast. Read the documentation for your provider to learn how to setup an object storage bucket, enable CORS, make the files public, and get the necessary credentials to provide to your Owncast configuration.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<ol>
<li>Visit your Owncast server setup page in the admin and view the Object Storage settings.</li>
<li>Enable it.</li>
<li>Visit your storage provider and create a new bucket.</li>
<li>Enter the bucket name, access key, secret key, and endpoint that your object storage provider&rsquo;s interface gave you into the Owncast settings. These have to be correct, so double check them. Contact your storage provider&rsquo;s support if you&rsquo;re not sure what these are.</li>
<li>Make sure your bucket is publicly accessible, and anybody can read files from it. Some storage providers may set your bucket as private by default, so you may need to change this setting.</li>
<li>If your storage provider requires you to setup any kind of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a> policy in order for your files to be accessed, make sure you do that. Visit your object storage provider&rsquo;s documentation to learn how to configure your CORS policy, as it&rsquo;s different for every provider. It&rsquo;s generally a good idea to allow all origins, but you can restrict it to your Owncast server if you have a specific need to do that, and you don&rsquo;t anticipate using your stream in other web pages. If your stream is not working and your browser console error log shows errors about <code>CORS</code> or <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>, this is likely the problem. This is often very common, so make sure your bucket is setup correctly.</li>

`},{id:33,href:"/docs/scaling/",title:"Scaling Owncast",description:"A place to start when needing to increase the capacity of your server.",content:`<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Owncast works great out of the box as a personal streaming service. The ease of install and all-in-one architecture allows for people to get up and running quickly. The downside of this is it requires a bit more thought around large deployments, as you can&rsquo;t just run more copies of Owncast for scale.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the topics below, or you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with the following steps it&rsquo;s unlikely you should be taking on the additional responsibility of a larger deployment of any service. <strong>Basic system administration experience and understanding of the architecture is generally expected when trying to squeeze additional performance out of anything</strong>, and this might not be for you. Don&rsquo;t feel bad. <strong>Owncast will still work great for you out of the box</strong>, but you might want to acquire some professional help if you need something more than that.</p>
<h2 id="video">Video</h2>
<h3 id="object-storage">Object Storage</h3>
<p>The first step for scaling your video to a large number of concurrent viewers is to use the built-in support for <a href="/docs/storage">external storage services</a>.</p>


<p>If the core problem is your server isn&rsquo;t able to handle your number of viewers you can take advantage of 3rd party object storage providers so your viewers will download the video from there instead of your server. This means if you have 1 or 1000 viewers the video video traffic from your server will be exactly the same. Keep in mind each viewer will still be accessing your server directly for chat.</p>
<p>This allows you to generate the video on your Owncast server, but serve it from a provider who has unlimited bandwidth and capacity at a low cost.</p>
<p>With this setup you don&rsquo;t need extra CPU or a more powerful server in order to support more viewers, as they don&rsquo;t technically touch your server once the video begins.</p>
<p><a href="/docs/storage">Read more about configuring external storage with Owncast</a>.</p>

<h3 id="content-delivery-networks-cdns">Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</h3>


<p>To support more people all around the world a CDN (content delivery network) is generally the next step. Putting a CDN in front of your video allows your video to be distributed by servers that are geographically closer to the viewer.</p>
<p><a href="/docs/cdns">Read more about using a CDN with Owncast</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>
<p>When scaling chat you&rsquo;re limited by what your single server will be able to handle as far as open connections. For most people the standard configuration is likely going to suffice, as it&rsquo;s been tested to thousands of concurrent clients.</p>
<p>Owncast will automatically increase the amount of concurrent sockets that your operating system will allow. However, if you still get the <code>too many open files</code> error it&rsquo;s because your <code>ulimit</code> value is lower than the number of open resources Owncast is trying to to use. You will want to have a more powerful server (cpu, ram) when raising the max limit and handle more chat connections.</p>
<p>You can increase concurrent connections by using the <code>ulimit</code> command or editing your system files. <a href="https://www.learnitguide.net/2015/07/how-to-increase-ulimit-values-in-linux.html">Here is an overview of the different limits and how to change them</a>. It&rsquo;s beyond the scope of this documentation to go into detail of what numbers you should use and where to put them.</p>
`},{id:34,href:"/docs/backups/",title:"Backups",description:"Owncast makes period backups of your data that can be restored.",content:`<p>Owncast will create a backup of your data periodically. It can be found in your <code>backup</code> directory as <code>owncastdb.bak</code>. You can add this to your normal system backups to keep your Owncast data safe.</p>
<span class="version-support">

<h2 id="restore">Restore</h2>
<p>Restoring an Owncast backup file will bring you back to the time the backup was created. This is useful if you want to move data to another machine, want to go back in time for some reason, or there&rsquo;s some type of problem you&rsquo;re looking to resolve.</p>
<ol>

`},{id:35,href:"/docs/old_troubleshooting/",title:"",description:null,content:`<h2 id="cpu-and-ram-usage-alerts">CPU and RAM usage alerts</h2>


<p>If your hardware is being maxed out then your video may not be processed and delivered fast enough to keep up with the real-time requirements of live video.</p>
<p>Each stream output quality adds significant CPU usage and slows down the overall generation of video segments. It&rsquo;s generally advised to start with one output, and then add additional, one at a time, to see how it impacts your CPU usage.</p>
<p>If your CPU is being over-utilized, here are some steps you can try taking to resolve this.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may have too many video outputs defined in your settings. Try limiting yourself to a single output, and go from there.</li>
<li>Change your settings to use <a href="/docs/encoding/#cpu-usage">less cpu</a>.</li>
<li>Experiment with reducing the bitrate and framerate of your video.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve gone down to a single output, changed to using less cpu, and experimented with different qualities in your broadcasting software, it&rsquo;s possible the server you&rsquo;re running Owncast is just not powerful enough for the task and you might need to try a different environment to run this on.</li>
<li>For your highest quality, match your Owncast server output bitrate exactly to what your broadcasting software is sending to minimize the amount of work your server has to do.</li>
<li>If you find you cannot accomplish encoding of any sort due to your server hardware, you may want to experiment with enabling <a href="/docs/video/#video-passthrough">video passthrough</a>, where your video is not re-encoded. However, this may not be a solution in all environments and there are often side effects. <a href="/docs/video/#video-passthrough">Read more</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, the easiest way to save CPU is to decrease the input size, decrease the output size, or both.</p>

<h2 id="buffering-and-video-playback-issues">Buffering and video playback issues</h2>
<p>Many things can be responsible for buffering and issues with the video playback. Here are some things to look into.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your <strong>hardware is not maxed out</strong> as detailed above.</li>
<li>Make sure your broadcasting computer is broadcasting live video reliably. If your own computer or network connection is having a hard time getting video to the internet then viewers will be stuck in a buffering state. <strong>Reduce the bitrate, resolution and/or framerate in your broadcasting software</strong> on your computer or mobile device if needed.</li>
<li>Try <strong>increasing your latency buffer</strong> in your settings. This will start the user further behind live but give the client more playable video before it gets stuck waiting for the live edge.</li>
<li><strong>Change your video settings</strong> to use <a href="/docs/encoding/#cpu-usage">less cpu</a> for encoding video. Possibly <a href="/docs/video/#video-passthrough">try passthrough</a>.</li>
<li>Reduce your <a href="/docs/configuration/#video-quality">stream quality settings</a> to a single output and a lower <a href="/docs/encoding/#bitrate">bitrate</a>. Experiment with increasing the bitrate and adding another optional stream output once you find settings that work for you.</li>
<li>If some of your viewers have no issues, but others are, you simply might need to add an additional bitrate output to your video configuration to accommodate more network conditions. Some people are geographically further away from you and might be getting your stream slower than others. Adding a lower quality stream output for these people often helps a lot.</li>
<li>If you are using external storage, <strong>make sure you&rsquo;re able to upload to this storage service fast enough</strong>. See below.</li>
</ol>
<p>To gain some insight into how your stream is performing for people, put your stream URL (https://yourserver/hls/stream.m3u8) into <a href="https://hlsanalyzer.com/">HLS Analyzer</a> to get a nice overview. You can see any errors or warnings from the end user&rsquo;s point of view by looking at its results.</p>
<h2 id="slow-uploads-to-external-storage">Slow uploads to external storage</h2>
<p>If you have a slow upload connection, or are uploading to an external storage service that is too far away, or not optimized for fast uploads, you may run into an issue where it takes too long to get the video segments uploaded, ultimately not making them available fast enough for them to be used.</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine if there&rsquo;s another endpoint for your storage service that might be geographically closer to you.</li>
<li>Use a storage service that&rsquo;s as close (physically and logically) to where your Owncast instance is. For example if if you&rsquo;re on an AWS machine, use a S3 bucket in the same region. If you&rsquo;re on Digital Ocean, try DO Spaces. But maybe don&rsquo;t use DO Spaces if you&rsquo;re on a Linode machine, use Linode Object Storage instead. Run owncast with <code>--enableVerboseLogging</code> to see if you get any slow upload warnings.</li>
<li>Try to increase your upload speed from your server provider.</li>
<li>Find out if your storage service offers something like <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html">AWS&rsquo;s Transfer Acceleration</a> to (possibly) try to increase the speed of uploads.</li>
<li>Reduce the quality of your video so the video segments are smaller and will take less time to upload. See the above tips for speeding up encoding.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="reducing-the-delay-between-the-viewer-and-live">Reducing the delay between the viewer and live</h2>
<p>Try decreasing your latency level in the admin. This will keep the user closer to live, but give the client less playable segments to work with, possibly <strong>reducing the resiliency for errors</strong> and network speed issues. If you have a machine that is able to process video quickly you may be able to get down to only a handful of seconds of latency, but with little room for error.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to you to decide you want lower delays over <strong>less reliability</strong> or a more reliable stream with additional delay.</p>
<p>If you are using <strong>Video Passthrough</strong> in your video configuration it will likely <strong>increase</strong> your latency. Because you&rsquo;re telling Owncast not to re-encode your video it can&rsquo;t optimally segment your video into the sized chunks required to manage your latency. If you really want to micro-manage latency then you&rsquo;re better off turning off Passthrough.</p>
<h2 id="chat-is-disabled">Chat is disabled</h2>
<p>The chat is only enabled when a stream is active. This is to stop drive-by spammy chat messages by people when no stream is taking place.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using a proxy in front of your Owncast instance make sure it is configured properly to support websockets. By default some do not pass along the websocket properly. Read <a href="/docs/sslproxies">your proxy documentation</a> to make sure websocket support is configured properly to support Owncast chat.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-are-immediately-disconnected-and-your-stream-wont-begin">If you are immediately disconnected and your stream won&rsquo;t begin.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you&rsquo;re running a supported version of ffmpeg. <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html">Download ffmpeg 4.1.5 or above</a>.</li>
<li>Look at your owncast logs in the console or your admin. There may be specific error messages to tell you what you can do next.</li>
<li>Take a look at <code>transcoder.log</code> for detailed logging that you can provide when asking for help if you don&rsquo;t see anything in the Owncast logs.</li>
<li>Make sure your copy of ffmpeg was not installed via Snap packages, as the sandboxing of Snap distributed software isn&rsquo;t compatible in this case. If you see the error <code>Error: unable to open display</code> in <code>transcoder.log</code>, this might be your problem.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="misc-video-issues">Misc video issues</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running into random video stability issues start by looking at some of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have <a href="/docs/video/#video-passthrough">video passthrough</a> <strong>disabled</strong>. I know you want to keep it on, but if you&rsquo;re having issues <strong>TURN IT OFF</strong>. If that doesn&rsquo;t fix it, then you can turn it back on later when you figure out the problem.</li>
<li>Look at your Owncast logs as well as <code>transcoder.log</code> to see if there are any errors that might be helpful.</li>
<li>To troubleshoot try a different source and/or a different player so when you ask for help you can know that it works for X but doesn&rsquo;t work for Y. Your stream is available at <code>/hls/stream.m3u8</code> so try putting that into VLC, Quicktime, etc.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re using a third party re-streaming, or web based streaming service, try streaming without it to see if it works. Again this helps when asking for help to let us know where the issue is.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="your-software-says-your-key-is-incorrect">Your software says your key is incorrect.</h2>
<p>If your broadcasting software says your streaming key is incorrect, but you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s not, verify you&rsquo;re not using any <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1">URL-unsafe characters</a> in your key. Characters such as <code>[ ] { } ? | \\ / ” % ~ # &lt; &gt;</code> are particularly problematic as your broadcasting software may not be encoding them properly.</p>
<h2 id="your-stream-looks-low-quality">Your stream looks low-quality</h2>
<p>Your stream, at the very least, is only as good as what you&rsquo;re sending to Owncast. So make sure you&rsquo;re sending from your broadcasting software at a quality that you&rsquo;re happy with. You may also want to increase the amount of CPU being used to process the video on your Owncast server. As you go lower you will visibly see the quality degrade. However, make sure your server can handle more CPU being used or you&rsquo;ll experience different problems.</p>
<h2 id="server-is-not-showing-up-in-the-directory">Server is not showing up in the directory</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve enabled the directory in your admin settings, <a href="/docs/directory/#if-your-server-is-not-showing-up-in-the-directory">look at some next steps</a> if it&rsquo;s not working.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re streaming content that has no audio component (such as a camera with no microphone, for example) you may run into issues. You&rsquo;re only likely to run into this if you&rsquo;re building a stream manually through something like ffmpeg. And in this case you can insert an audio stream that&rsquo;s empty to resolve the issue.</p>
