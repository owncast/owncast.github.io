If you have a 100MB file, and you zip it, and it becomes 70MB, you can send that 70MB file to as many people as you want without zipping that file again for each person. But you still need to send the file to each person seperately, requiring network bandwidth for each time you send it. However, if you want to send some people a 70MB version and others a 50MB version, you'll need to create two seperate files. That 50MB version will take longer and use more CPU to create, because of the additional work it takes to compress the file more. This is the same with video. The more work required to encode your video, the more CPU that's required. Generally, the more you need to reduce the size and bitrate of your video, the more CPU that will be used.
