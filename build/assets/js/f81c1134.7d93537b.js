improvements from the web overhaul that came with v0.1.0. With so many changes we knew there\'d be a a slew of bug fixes to come along after.

entirety. There are many changes and it\'s important for you to know what has changed and how it will affect you.\\n\\n## Three years of Owncast!\\n\\nThe first commit to Owncast was May 23, 2020. It\'s been a wild ride seeing what everyone has been streaming and all the creative use cases people have come up with. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the project, and to everyone who has been using it. I won\'t use this place to talk about how awesome you all are, but here\'s to many more years of your streams!\\n\\n## A big update!\\n\\nOwncast v0.1.0 is a large update with many changes to the web interface. It is a complete rewrite of the frontend and like any rewrite it results in many improvements, but also room for bugs and regressions. Please report any issues you find to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues).\\n\\nThis release is made up of over [380 completed tasks](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/18?closed=1). That\'s not 380 commits, 380 standalone tasks. That\'s so much stuff. If you\'re interested in some behind the scenes there\'s blog posts about [Owncast design](https://gabekangas.com/blog/2023/02/owncast-v0.1.0-retrospective-redesign/) and [the web project](https://gabekangas.com/blog/2023/02/owncast-v0.1.0-retrospective-frontend-web-rewrite/).\\n\\nIt may make sense for some who relied on heavy customization in previous versions to test out this release outside of your production install of Owncast to make sure any visual customization you previously made can be moved over.\\n\\n## A special thank you to the contributors for this release\\n\\nThis release was a large undertaking and would not have been possible without the help of all the people who pitched in their skills to make it happen. A full list is at the bottom of these release notes.\\n\\n## Goals of this release\\n\\nWith all the future features that we want to add to Owncast it was required to take a step back and rebuild the web frontend from scratch so it would be easier to add to and maintain. This release is the result of that work.\\n\\nThe goals of this release were:\\n\\n1. Make it easier to work on and contribute to, especially first time contributors to Owncast.\\n1. Make it load faster.\\n1. Be more accessible.\\n1. Be more mobile friendly.\\n1. Be easier to customize.\\n1. Set us up for future features.\\n\\n## Web source code is no longer included in releases\\n\\nOne side-effect of these changes is we no longer ship the raw web source code with each release. This was previously the `webroot` directory. While most people didn\'t take advantage of this in the past, some did. If you find there are things you can no longer do that you once did there are two options:\\n\\n1. Download the Owncast source code and build it yourself, editing what you need.\\n2. Open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues) and let us know what you used to be able to do that you no longer can.\\n\\nWe hope the addition of additional customization options in the admin will make up for this change.\\n\\n### Webroot directory\\n\\nWhile the `webroot` directory will not be automatically deleted, and any files you had previously manually put there will be safe, it will no longer be used for anything and you are free to delete it yourself when you\'re ready.\\n\\n## Appearance customization\\n\\nThe new appearance section under **General** settings in the Owncast admin allows for an easier approach to customizing your instance. While you could, and still can, write your own CSS, the new options allow you to customize the appearance of your Owncast instance without writing any CSS by selecting colors other miscellaneous options.\\n\\nWhile not every single individual component or element can be customized via point-and-click, we hope this at least gives most people a simpler to customize right out of the box. Via CSS you can still customize anything you want and CSS variables can be set manually.\\n\\n**Note** that any CSS you had written for previous releases of Owncast will not be compatible with the new version, as the entire web frontend changed.\\n\\nRead more about the appearance customization page in the [Appearance customization](/docs/appearance/) guide.\\n\\n## Insert custom Javascript\\n\\nUnder the **General** settings page you can add custom Javascript to your Owncast instance\'s web page. Read more about this in the [documentation](/docs/custom-javascript/).\\n\\n## Streaming keys and admin password\\n\\nPreviously the admin password and stream key were the same. Due to requests these have been split up, and you can now create any number of streaming keys. Most people will continue to not need this functionality, but if you have a specific use case where you have multiple streamers, and you don\'t want any of them to access the admin for some reason, this is now possible.\\n\\n**By default the admin password and single stream key are both the same**. So you should see no difference when upgrading to this new release.\\n\\n## Custom emoji\\n\\nThe default custom emoji set has been replaced with images that we are confident can be shipped with Owncast due to their license. Those who have been using Owncast from previous versions, however, will keep their images and only new users will get the new emoji set.\\n\\nA new emoji page has been added to the Admin under `Chat & Users -> Emojis` where you can add and remove your own custom emoji images without having to access your server\'s filesystem. If you do want to manually manage these files, however, they can be now found in the `data/emoji` directory.\\n\\nRead more details about custom emoji in the [documentation](/docs/chat/emoji/)\\n\\n## Chat colors\\n\\nAs a participant in the chat you can now change your color, not just your name. The selection of colors can be customized via the appearance customization page. Additionally as an admin you can change the set of colors available to your users to match your preferences.\\n\\n## Hide viewer count\\n\\nSome people prefer to not display a viewer count, and now that can be accomplished by turning it off in the admin under `General` settings.\\n\\n## Offline banner\\n\\nWhen your stream is not live a new \\"Offline Banner\\" is displayed with either a default or custom message. This can be customized in the admin under `General` settings. This is a good way to leave a message such as when you normally stream, or if you\'re taking a break.\\n\\n## Write HTML for external action buttons\\n\\nYou\'ve always been able to link to external URLs to display when you press action buttons on the page, but now you can choose to write your own HTML to display instead. Visit `Integrations -> External Actions` in the admin.\\n\\n## Host your own public assets\\n\\nIf you need to host your own images, fonts, css files or anything you need to make publicly available you can do so via the new `data/public` directory. Most people will not need this, but if you previously used to put assets in your `webroot` directory to make them publicly accessible, this would be the replacement of that.\\n\\n## Admin pages\\n\\nSome admin pages have been combined and some URLs have changed. Particularly have a look at the \\"General\\" and the \\"Server config\\" pages to find additional sections like S3 Object Storage and custom CSS.\\n\\n## Built-in Twitter notifications have been removed\\n\\nPrimarily due to Twitter removing external API access to their service, but also due to Twitter being Twitter, this feature has been removed and will no longer be internally supported. If you still require this specific functionality you can use Webhooks to build something custom.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Changelog\\n\\n## [[0.1.0](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/18)] - 2023-05-30 aka \\"Gabe\'s Birthday Release\\"\\n\\n## Upgrade instructions from 0.0.13\\n\\n1.

While it can\'t be guaranteed to detect all issues with all players, it should be able to give you relative confidence when things are going well, and help you identity specific issues that you can resolve when troubleshooting.\\n\\nIt should be noted that only those who are viewing your stream via the Owncast web interface, and only those not using Webkit-based browsers, will have their detailed metrics available. The page will tell you what percentage of the viewers are represented in the numbers.\\n\\n## Authentication\\n\\nSome options for chat user authentication have been added. This allows people to reclaim their identity when people move between browsers, devices, or prefer to use Owncast using private browsing features. This is especially useful if you are a moderator and want to reclaim your moderation role, but in general it\'s for anybody who wants to have a stable identity in chat. It\'s not required, and most casual viewers should probably never have to take advantage of it unless they especially want to.\\n\\nAs a secondary benefit, those who choose to authenticate will have their chat display name locked to their identity and others cannot use it. This should hopefully be a good compromise between locking all display names and locking no display names. However this is still just a display attribute and there\'s nothing stopping people from creating names that may look similar to yours.\\n\\nAuthenticated users will have a checkmark next to their name in chat.\\n\\nThere are two different ways you can authenticate with Owncast chat, allowing you to restore your identity between browsers.\\n\\n### IndieAuth\\n\\n[IndieAuth](https://indieauth.net/) is a decentralized identity protocol that allows an individual\'s web site to become its own identity provider. Owncast itself, is now an IndieAuth provider you can use to authenticate against Owncast instances, or any other site that supports IndieAuth.\\n\\nThe clear use case is using your Owncast instance to authenticate with chat on other Owncast instances. Alternatively you can test this functionality by logging into [The IndieWeb Wiki](https://indieweb.org/), [Telegraph](https://telegraph.p3k.io/), or [This IndieAuth test page](https://pin13.net/login/). Simply put in the URL of v0.0.12+ Owncast server when logging in.\\n\\nKeep in mind this is just for Owncast instance admins, and you use the same username/password as you do when logging into the Owncast Admin.\\n\\n### Fediverse Auth\\n\\nFor Owncast instances with Fediverse functionality enabled you can be sent a one-time-password that works similarly to when you log in with your phone number on different services. You can use this code to authenticate with Owncast chat. You must allow direct/private messages on your Fediverse account from the Owncast instance.\\n\\n## Chat Banning via IP\\n\\nUsers that have been banned from chat will now have their IP address automatically blocked. You can remove IP address blocks from the admin separately from the user ban.\\n\\n## Established chat user mode\\n\\nEnabling this mode will stop newly created chat users from being able to chat. It should be seen as an \\"anti-troll mode\\" that you can turn on if some new people drop by your chat just to harass and annoy.\\n\\n## Prometheus Metrics\\n\\nYou can now optionally use a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics server to monitor your Owncast instance. You can add `/api/admin/prometheus` to your Prometheus configuration to consume the metrics.\\n\\n## Experimental Lower Latency Playback\\n\\nSome viewers may enable a new, experimental, feature in the player settings for streams that can benefit from lower latency playback. If you find yourself getting excessive buffering or playback issues with your stream after turning it on it\'s suggested you not use it at this time. It would also be appreciated if you find issues to let us know what stream you\'re using this with so we can continue to improve the feature.\\n\\nOnly viewers using the Owncast web interface and not using a webkit-powered browser will have this feature available. A stable and fast stream is required for this feature to perform its intended function.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nIf all goes according to plan this will be the last update before releasing a rewrite of the Owncast web interface. This will allow the project to move faster on the frontend going forward, so big features on the roadmap can be worked on.\\n\\nWork is already in progress, but it\'ll be a [long road](https://inv.riverside.rocks/watch?v=-inVvjyE7Fg) to feature parity. I hope you\'ll be patient as the frontend is focused on this next time around.\\n\\nThis update will impact most users, so as time goes on I\'ll make sure to update everyone on what to expect, and optionally how to prepare to take advantage of the new features.\\n\\n# Changelog\\n\\n## [[0.0.12](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/17)] - 2022-07-09\\n\\n## Upgrade instructions from 0.0.11\\n\\n1. Stop the service from running. If you\'re using a pre-installed image through a hosting provider, or setup Owncast to run under systemd you can probably just simply run `systemctl stop owncast`.\\n1.

Some popular Fediverse services are [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/) but many services that make up the Fediverse can start to receive posts from your Owncast server.\\n\\nWith this ability, it gives you something pretty cool: the ability for people to follow your server and share it with their own followers. Your followers now show in a new \\"Followers\\" tab in the interface, and as people interact with your server by following, sharing and liking, it will show up in the chat so your biggest supporters get highlighted.\\n\\nYou\'ll automatically let your followers know each time you go live, and you can send them messages from the admin letting them know about your future streaming plans.\\n\\nThis functionality, of course, is disabled by default, as Owncast always wants you to be completely private out of the box. It\'s up to you to enable this in the admin under the new \\"Social\\" config section. If you\'d like to turn this on, but still only allow specific people be involved, you can turn on social \\"Private Mode\\" where you have to manually approve each follower that wants to know about your streams, and in that case they will be unable to share your server with others.\\n\\nWe look forward to continued features being built now that federation with Owncast is enabled.\\n\\nA **huge** thank you to [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/project/Owncast/) for funding the development of Owncast Federation through the [NGI0 Discovery Fund](https://nlnet.nl/discovery).\\n\\nIf you\'d like to hear a discussion around the thoughts behind these new features, [check out our conversation on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeVvS0E-z3g).\\n\\n**Note**: The Fediverse is the wild west, and while people have been running with this functionality for some time in testing, we don\'t know what you\'ll run into. Please let us know if you discover any issues or any services that are not being compatible with Owncast or causing problems with your server.\\n\\nWe hope to allow further interoperability with more ActivityPub services in the future.\\n\\n## Moderators\\n\\nLong requested, and now finally here. You can assign moderator privileges to yourself, and any of your chat members and they will have the ability to remove chat messages and ban users directly from the chat, without having to go into the Admin.\\n\\nOf course this relies on people keeping their identity between visits to your chat, so those that use private browsing to visit your server will be seen as a completely different chat participant each time, and will no longer have their moderator privileges unless you re-grant them.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/images/moderator-menu.png\\"/>\\n\\n## Upgrade instructions from 0.0.10\\n\\n1. Stop the service from running. If you\'re using a pre-installed image through a hosting provider, or setup Owncast to run under systemd you can probably just simply run `systemctl stop owncast`.\\n1. Change to the directory where Owncast is installed on your server.\\n1. If you\u2019ve customized your web interface in any way you will want to back up the files you\u2019ve changed or customized.\\n1. Re-run the installer as the user you run Owncast under. For example if you are running owncast as the user \\"owncast\\": `su -c \\"curl https://owncast.online/install.sh |bash\\" owncast`\\n1. Restart the service. If you\'re running under systemd `systemctl start owncast`.\\n\\n# Changelog\\n\\n## [[0.0.11](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/14)] - 2022-03-05\\n\\n# Major updates\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Promote chat participants to moderators [\\\\#499](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/499)\\n\\n- Additional target framerates [\\\\#1138](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/1138)\\n\\n- Support path-based S3 storage [\\\\#1495](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/1495)\\n\\n- Inline UI to allow people to perform moderation actions within chat [\\\\#1291](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/1291)\\n\\n- Add a recommendation in the admin to add a second, lower quality if only one is set [\\\\#1491](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/1491)\\n\\n- Add support for checking the local filesystem for static resources [\\\\#1507](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/1507)\\n\\n- Add list of moderators in user admin [\\\\#1511](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/1511)\\n\\n- New admin section for managing ActivityPub settings.

Please read through the below release notes and let us know what you think about this release. Your feedback drives the roadmap of Owncast, and we want to build the things that are most useful to you.\\n\\nHere are some notable chat updates you may be interested in:\\n\\n### Moderation\\n\\nWhile Owncast has had existing support for hiding chat messages, this new release is the first time you can ban an entire user from chat. By visiting the new `Chat -> Users` admin page and seeing the list of currently connected chat users, you can press the \\"Ban\\" button to disconnect them from chat, hide all their messages, and ban that user from reconnecting.\\n\\n### Disabling chat\\n\\nTurning off chat in the settings previously would hide the chat UI from your viewers, but the chat functionality still was enabled behind the scenes. Now if you turn it off chat is no longer supported. Because you can turn off chat completely the number of viewers is no longer counted by the number of people connected to chat, instead it is counted separately.\\n\\n### Chat usernames\\n\\nUnder the new Chat settings page in the admin you can add a list of names or words you don\'t want to allow people to use in their chat usernames. This way you can stop people from having fake names like \\"Admin\\" to mislead people.\\n\\nAlso, default usernames are no longer \\"UserXX\\", but instead a randomly generated string.\\n\\n### Chat connection limits\\n\\nPreviously we didn\'t suggest more than 1,000 people to be connected to the Owncast chat, but with this revision it\'s been tested to many times that, though you may see more or less depending on your server and how it\'s configured. In general most people should no longer be limited in chat capacity.\\n\\n### Custom chat emoji\\n\\nYou can now input, and autocomplete, custom emoji in chat by typing `:emojiname:`. Hover over emoji in the chat to see the name of it. By typing part of an emoji name, such as `:dancing` and hitting `tab` it will attempt to auto-complete it for you just like it does with usernames when you type `@user` and hit `tab`.\\n\\n### New standalone embeddable chat\\n\\nThere\'s now a standalone chat interface located at `/embed/chat/readwrite` that you can embed in an iframe anywhere you like, allowing you to easily have the full chat in a custom interface that you design.\\n\\nThis is also useful for streamers who just want to bring up a full-screen chat to use when streaming.\\n\\n# Changelog\\n\\n## [[0.0.8](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/13)] - 2021-08-11\\n\\n## Upgrade instructions from 0.0.7\\n\\n1. Stop the service from running. If you\'re using a pre-installed image through a hosting provider, or setup Owncast to run under systemd you can probably just simply run `systemctl stop owncast`.\\n1. Change to the directory where Owncast is installed on your server. In a pre-installed hosting scenario it\'s likely in `/opt/owncast`.\\n1. If you\u2019ve customized your web interface in any way you will want to back up the files you\u2019ve changed or customized.\\n1. Re-run the installer as the user you run Owncast under. For example if you are running owncast as the user \\"owncast\\": `su -c \\"curl https://owncast.online/install.sh |bash\\" owncast`\\n1. Restart the service. If you\'re running under systemd `systemctl start owncast`.\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\n[As noted previously](https://owncast.online/news/20210615-apis-future-releases/), two APIs will no longer be available:\\n\\n- `/api/integrations/chat/user` is no longer supported, removing the ability to send a chat message as arbitrary users.

improve the day to day usage of Owncast. The biggest being the ability to use hardware accelerated video codecs and free up your CPU if you\'re running on dedicated hardware. This is great for people who are hosting from home, even on things like a Raspberry Pi. Other additions people have asked for such as being able to upload your logo directly from the admin, hiding chat, custom CSS, being able to manually select a video stream quality from the player and more are included in this update. Read the below changelog for more details.\\n\\n## Upgrade instructions from 0.0.6\\n\\n1. Stop the service from running via whatever method you have Owncast running.\\n1. [Download the updated Owncast release](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/releases/tag/v0.0.7) for your platform.\\n1. Move the zip file of 0.0.7 to your previous install location.\\n1. If you\'ve customized your web interface in any way **you will want to back up the files you\'ve changed or customized.**\\n1. Unzip the file, allowing it to overwrite old files.\\n1. Restart the service.\\n\\n**Beta:** The [Owncast installer](https://owncast.online/quickstart) has support for upgrades, but this functionality is new. So feel free to give it a try by re-running it in your Owncast directory.\\n\\nFor installing from scratch, see the [Quickstart](https://owncast.online/quickstart).\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\n- Remote images will no longer be supported in chat. There were more cons than pros to have this, so it has been removed.\\n- Values around the Latency Buffer have been changed and a setting you selected in a previous release may not result in the exact same functionality as we continue to tweak the values for best performance.\\n\\n# Major updates\\n\\n## Hardware + Additional Codec support\\n\\nThis release adds initial support for using different video codecs in your encoding. If you have hardware, drivers, and software that supports it, you might be able to use VA-API, NVENC (nvidia) or OpenMAX (Raspberry Pi) codecs. Read more about the effort involved and the requisite software you will need to have installed [in our documentation](/docs/codecs).\\n\\n## News in the admin\\n\\nWe added a general purpose place to put information that may be of interest to people operating Owncast instances. Since we\'re not focused on having a social media presence, we wanted a simple way to reach out to people running Owncast if there\'s anything useful or important. This simply pulls a static [RSS feed](https://owncast.online/news/index.json) from our web site that is hosted on Github pages, so we have no logs of this request. Additionally we [wipe out the referrer value](https://github.com/owncast/owncast-admin/blob/develop/utils/apis.ts#L122) in this request. Feel free to reach out if you have any concerns.\\n\\n## More detailed logging\\n\\nTo assist people in troubleshooting things that go wrong, this release offers more detailed logging around video. You may see more warnings than you\'re used to seeing, and generally if your server is functioning properly you can ignore them. However, feel free to reach out if you are seeing warnings that you\'re finding unhelpful and we will make sure those warnings are cleared up in future releases.\\n\\n## Others\\n\\n- You can now give stream output variants names and they\'ll be displayed in the player for viewers to manually select.\\n- 3rd party content modal for building your own simple UI that can be popped up within the Owncast web page.\\n- Chat can be hidden.\\n- You can upload your logo via the admin.\\n- You can do some basic CSS overrides via the admin.\\n\\n# Changelog\\n\\n## [[0.0.7](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/milestone/12)] - 2021-05-15\\n\\n### Added\\n\\n- Multiple codec selection for hardware accelerated encoding [\\\\#892](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/pull/892), [\\\\#336](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/336)\\n- Ability to select quality from web player [\\\\#655](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/655)\\n- Add name to stream output variants [\\\\#743](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/743)\\n- Allow system messages to utilize full html for styling [\\\\#747](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/747)\\n- Allow admins to disable the chat [\\\\#472](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/472)\\n- 3rd party actions + content modal [\\\\#679](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/679)\\n- Add noreferrer to all Owncast and Owncast-admin links to owncast.online documentation [\\\\#822](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/822)\\n- Add ability to upload logo via the admin [\\\\#716](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/716)\\n- Show initial loading spinner on the player [\\\\#848](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/848)\\n- Show news/updates in the admin [\\\\#865](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/865)\\n- Provide RTMP URL in the admin page next to the stream key [\\\\#861](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/861)\\n- Detect if ffmpeg is installed via snap [\\\\#762](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/762)\\n- Add more user-facing helpful error messages from the transcoder [\\\\#763](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/763)\\n- Add css page styling form in the admin [\\\\#718](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/718)\\n- Add explicit FLoC opt-out headers in all http responses [\\\\#939](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/939)\\n- Running OwnCast with `webserverport` will save that port in the config [\\\\#860](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/860)\\n- Page loading background/splash image [\\\\#849](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/849)\\n- Extend keyboard controls [\\\\#670](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/670)\\n- Make transparency of message bubbles overridable via CSS [\\\\#910](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/910)\\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n- Guard against instance continuing to ping the directory API after stream has ended [\\\\#600](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/600)\\n- Changing the Sever URL in the admin should not appear to reset Name and About [\\\\#854](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/854)\\n- Chat message type check can cause crash [\\\\#856](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/856)\\n- Admin development: Broken images [\\\\#798](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/798)\\n- Admin social handles interface can span wider than its container [\\\\#845](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/845)\\n- Use a unique path for the fifo pipe to allow multiple copies to run on a single machine [\\\\#883](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/883)\\n- Resolve an issue impacting chat moderation not hiding messages [\\\\#809](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/809)\\n- Fix issue where local hls storage may not exist if number of output streams changed [\\\\#940](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/940)\\n- Play button would display over the header bar when scrolling [\\\\#951](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/951)\\n\\n### Changed\\n\\n- Chat welcome message is now customizable, but empty/disabled by default [\\\\#723](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/723)\\n\\n### Removed\\n\\n- Limit image loading to only come from the local server. No more remote images in chat. [\\\\#756](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/756)\\n\\n### Notes about future releases\\n\\nThis will be the the last release to allow external access to the websocket. If you have built tools or utilities that utilize getting chat events it is recommended that you migrate to supported [3rd party APIs](https://owncast.online/thirdparty/) instead. If you have a use case that doesn\'t fit these APIs please let us know and in the future we may find a safe way to support the features you require.\\n\\n## Thank you to our contributors!\\n\\nThank you to the contributors for v0.0.7: [nebunez](https://github.com/nebunez), [gabek](https://github.com/gabek), [thilobillerbeck](https://github.com/thilobillerbeck), [aral](https://github.com/aral), [gingervitis](https://github.com/gingervitis), [controlfreakstudio](https://github.com/controlfreakstudio), [MFTabriz](https://github.com/MFTabriz) as well as all of the fantastic people helping out in the [Owncast chat](https://owncast.rocket.chat) answering questions, testing and providing feedback.\\n\\n## Thank you to our financial supporters!\\n\\nThank you to those financially supporting Owncast.

Audio will pass through the source audio as it has previously.\\n- Peak viewer counts have been removed from the public-facing `status` API. [\\\\#771](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/pull/771)\\n\\n## Docker\\n\\nIf you\'re running [Owncast under Docker](/docs/quickstart/container) it\'s suggested you bind your `data` directory so you have access to your database file, backups, etc.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Major updates\\n\\n### Admin\\n\\nBeginning with 0.0.6 you will configure your Owncast server via the admin at `/admin`. You\'ll be able to make changes faster, easier, and without restarting your server. We hope with this updated interface that you\'ll be able to make simpler and more informed decisions about how to configure your server and video settings.\\n\\nPlease share any feedback you have as we want to continue to improve and make it easier and faster for you to run and manage your streams.\\n\\n### Stream title\\n\\nYou\'ll now see in the admin a text field for adding an optional \\"Stream Title\\", a way to describe what your current stream is. This is especially useful for people who may stream multiple different things in one session, or every day have new content that you\'d like to call out. So you can set it to \\"Playing Assassin\'s Creed\\", and then change it to \\"Doing some live coding\\".\\n\\n## Third party integration & add-on APIs\\n\\nOwncast now lets you build add-ons and integrations on top of it. Some good examples are chat bots, video stream overlays, changing the stream title when things happen, or creating chat actions such as notifying people when somebody has donated or followed.\\n\\n[Learn more about these APIs](/docs/api/apis) and you can start building for your Owncast server. Feel free to ask us any questions. This is all brand new, and we want to give you what you need to build great things.\\n\\n## Backups\\n\\nThe `backup` directory will include a periodic backup of your Owncast server data.
