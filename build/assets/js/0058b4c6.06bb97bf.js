If you have a machine that is able to process video quickly you may be able to get down to only a handful of seconds of latency, but with little room for error."},"troubleshoot/shared/relocate-physical-server":{"id":"troubleshoot/shared/relocate-physical-server","title":"relocate-physical-server","description":"You may have better luck running Owncast on a server that could be more centrally geographically located or has a connection to the world that is faster. If your server is physically distant from both you (to stream to) and your viewers (to consume video from) you may not be in the most optimal configuration."},"troubleshoot/shared/slow-storage-uploads":{"id":"troubleshoot/shared/slow-storage-uploads","title":"slow-storage-uploads","description":"If you are using external storage, make sure you\u2019re able to upload to this storage service fast enough. Otherwise the delay in your files arriving at the storage provider that everyone is using to view the video will cause buffering."},"troubleshoot/shared/stream-health":{"id":"troubleshoot/shared/stream-health","title":"stream-health","description":"There\u2019s no point streaming if nobody is able to watch it. Using the \u201cStream Health\u201d screen in the admin you can get an overview of some important metrics that may give you an idea if what you\u2019re offering your viewers is leading to a good experience."},"troubleshoot/shared/use-cdn":{"id":"troubleshoot/shared/use-cdn","title":"use-cdn","description":"To support more people all around the world a CDN (content delivery network) is generally the next step. Putting a CDN in front of your video allows your video to be distributed by servers that are geographically closer to the viewer."},"troubleshoot/shared/use-storage":{"id":"troubleshoot/shared/use-storage","title":"use-storage","description":"If the core problem is your server isn\'t able to handle your number of viewers you can take advantage of 3rd party object storage providers so your viewers will download the video from there instead of your server. This means if you have 1 or 1000 viewers the video video traffic from your server will be exactly the same. Keep in mind each viewer will still be accessing your server directly for chat."},"troubleshoot/shared/video-passthrough-mode":{"id":"troubleshoot/shared/video-passthrough-mode","title":"video-passthrough-mode","description":"Note: This is generally not recommended and can often cause playback issues for your viewers."},"troubleshoot/stream-disconnect":{"id":"troubleshoot/stream-disconnect","title":"Disconnect while streaming","description":""},"troubleshoot/video-errors":{"id":"troubleshoot/video-errors","title":"Video related errors","description":"Troubleshoot video related errors in Owncast logs"},"troubleshooting/buffering/all":{"id":"troubleshooting/buffering/all","title":"All viewers are experiencing buffering","description":"","sidebar":"docs"},"troubleshooting/buffering/geo":{"id":"troubleshooting/buffering/geo","title":"Viewers further away are experiencing buffering","description":"","sidebar":"docs"},"troubleshooting/buffering/slow-networks":{"id":"troubleshooting/buffering/slow-networks","title":"Stream is buffering for those with mobile or slow networks","description":"","sidebar":"docs"},"troubleshooting/change-streamkey":{"id":"troubleshooting/change-streamkey","title":"Change your streaming key & admin password","description":"Change the key you use for streaming and logging into your admin.","sidebar":"docs"},"troubleshooting/chat/offline":{"id":"troubleshooting/chat/offline","title":"Chat is offline","description":"","sidebar":"docs"},"troubleshooting/chat/offline-while-not-streaming":{"id":"troubleshooting/chat/offline-while-not-streaming","title":"Chat is offline while not streaming","description":"","sidebar":"docs"},"troubleshooting/chat/offline-while-streaming":{"id":"troubleshooting/chat/offline-while-streaming","title":"Chat is offline while streaming","description":"","sidebar":"docs"},"troubleshooting/dropped-frames":{"id":"troubleshooting/dropped-frames","title":"Dropped frames","description":"","sidebar":"docs"},"troubleshooting/hardware-usage":{"id":"troubleshooting/hardware-usage","title":"Hardware Utilization","description":"The more video encoding work required the more hardware utilization that will take place.
