As we learn more and continue to make things that are useful to other developers we may need to make changes or break functionality. It's recommended if you're building on top of Owncast to stay current with the discussions and updates around the project and let us know how things are going.</description></item><item><title>Quickstart_olds</title><link>/quickstart_old/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 20:11:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/quickstart_old/</guid><description/></item><item><title>About the Owncast Project</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>In 2020 the world changed when everyone become stuck in their homes, looking for creative outlets to share their art, skills and themselves from inside their bedroom.
This created an explosion of live streaming on Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Instagram, and Twitch. These services provided everything they needed, an easy way to live stream to the world, and a chat for users to be a part of their community.
There deserves to be a better option for people.</description></item><item><title>Chat one-on-one about Owncast</title><link>/1-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/1-1/</guid><description>The best way for Owncast to be something that&amp;rsquo;s useful to the most people is to hear what people have to say.

Simply following the Quickstart will have you streaming in minutes.
There are, however, handfuls of items you can configure to tweak the content of your page, the video quality, server performance and more.
You can also extend Owncast&amp;rsquo;s functionality by building your own bots, overlays, tools and integrations by taking advantage of the third party APIs.</description></item><item><title>Donated Owncast servers</title><link>/donated/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/donated/</guid><description>If you or your organization has content to share with the world, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the experience or resources required to run an Owncast server, we may be able to offer one, free of charge.
Our Goal Aligning with our mission to create a streaming option that lives outside the large corporate services, we would like to offer a small number of free, hosted instances to streamers.
Our resources are limited, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be picky and start small.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/faq/</guid><description>1. Who is this for? Owncast is for people who are live streamers, or who wants to host live streams for others. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;one to many&amp;rdquo; broadcast much like Twitch, Facebook Live, YouTube Live, etc.
2. Who or what is this not for? Owncast is not for video conferencing or any use case where multiple people are wanting to see video of each other. It&amp;rsquo;s also not a good choice if you have tight real-time requirements as HLS video has inherent delays.</description></item><item><title>Help contribute to Owncast!</title><link>/help/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/help/</guid><description>Owncast is a growing open source project that is giving freedom, flexibility and fun to live streamers.

If you run an Owncast server, you run your own software, therefore we don&amp;rsquo;t know who you are or what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. If you opt to be listed in the Owncast directory, everything we know about you is what is listed publicly. When you access our web servers, such as reading documentation or visiting the Owncast directory, we count the number of views. You can see everything we see by visiting our web analytics page.</description></item><item><title>Owncast APIs</title><link>/api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/api/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Owncast Contributor T-Shirt</title><link>/tshirt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tshirt/</guid><description>Thank you!

This enables the project to discuss things far in advance to make the best possible decisions as well as allowing Owncast users to know what types of updates they can expect. As time goes on planning for specific releases get more detailed, and it's very common for additional, smaller, releases to get slipped in between larger features to fix bugs and address feedback.</description></item><item><title>Owncast Quickstart</title><link>/quickstart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/quickstart/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Owncast Releases</title><link>/releases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/releases/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Participate in Hacktoberfest with Owncast</title><link>/hacktoberfest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hacktoberfest/</guid><description>Some of the information about Hacktoberfest was copied here from the official Hacktoberfest website and should be referenced for more information.
